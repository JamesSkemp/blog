<p>
Sitting in on a seminar, I was introduced to one of more popular email confirmation tools for blogs, called Bloglet.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Looking into this tool, however, I wasn&#39;t very satisfied with what it is.  It seems that it&#39;s not a tool that can be installed on a server, but must be linked to from your site.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, <a href="http://www.skippy.net/blog/category/wordpress/plugins/subscribe2/">Subscribe2</a> allows me to have direct control over both the emails that are sent, the individuals who subscribe, and over up-time ;)  Thanks, I&#39;ll keep things in-house as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
That said, subscribe to the service by clicking on the link in the sidebar to the right, or by clicking on this fancy link right here: receive an email notification when this area is updated. [UPDATE: Removed.]
</p>
<p>
Comments and thoughts on this method of delivery are greatly appreciated.
