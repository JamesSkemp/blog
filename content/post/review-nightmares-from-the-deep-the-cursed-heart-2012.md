<h3>A good way to get into the genre</h3>

<p>(I played the Steam version of this game, and this review is based upon that.)</p>

<p>This was the first real hidden object game I played, thanks to a kind Reddit user who gifted me a key. It was actually quite good, with great artwork. The animated bits suffer from a bit of pixelation, but it doesn't detract too much from the game.</p>

<p>The puzzles are relatively easy, but the hint option is there if you need it (just make sure you don't accidentally hit it while walking about :( ). It took me about four and a half hours to beat.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/259740/">Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart</a> gets four of five stars, and seems to be a good way to get into the genre.</p>
