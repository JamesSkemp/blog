<p>
The following thoughts are from approximately 10:20 last night.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	While I&#39;d like to believe that technology is good, part of me believes the opposite. So close are they, in fact, that I can make no decision one way or another, try as I might.
	</p>
	<p>
	While it&#39;s true science can heal us, all too often life itself is placed above the reason for life - the reason to live.
	</p>
	<p>
	True, we will soon be living longer and longer, but at what price? And more importantly, why should we?
	</p>
