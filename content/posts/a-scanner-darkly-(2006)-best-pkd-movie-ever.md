This last weekend I watched A Scanner Darkly, which had just hit a local Madison theatre on Friday.  I&#39;d been looking forward to the film since I&#39;d heard about it, and since it promised to showcase a look like <a href="http://strivinglife.com/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">Waking Life</a>.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

After watching the film, I was certainly impressed.  I was afraid that Linklater was going to add his own spin to it, but he actually did quite well.  Of the various movies based on pieces by Philip K. Dick, I&#39;d say that A Scanner Darkly plays very close to the work.
</p>
<p>
However, when compared with Blade Runner, Scanner just doesn&#39;t have the same stunning imagery.  Of course, it&#39;s hard to compare any science fiction movie to Blade Runner, and especially difficult to compare a Dick-based movie to it (since PKD had some impact on Blade Runner - he was still alive for some of the shooting).
</p>
<p>
Once Scanner hits DVD, perhaps it will become memorable, and I dare say it&#39;s the second-best PKD movie thus far, and certainly one that mimics the novel the most (although a quick reading will show that it&#39;s certainly not that close - less than 20 pages in will show one semi-major difference).
</p>
<p>
Great acting, and great imagery which was the best way this film could have been done (how else could they really do the suit?).
</p>
<p>
Definitely looking forward to purchasing the DVD - that&#39;s what I&#39;ll leave it at for now.
