<p>
I forgot to comment on this the other day, when I first read the post. 
</p>
<p>
Jeff Atwood, of Coding Horror,&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;piece titled&nbsp;&quot;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001112.html" target="_blank">Understanding Model-View-Controller</a>&quot; which brought forth this response from Shmork (I wish he would have posted a site): 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	I have to admit, as someone with more philosophical inclinations, I wonder whether the stated goal of totally separating content from representation is even a good idea. Certainly no graphic designer would sign on to that theory of the world, much less a philosophically inclined graphic designer. The world is not actually made up, ontologically, of objects whose logical value and whose representational value is totally separate&mdash;they are deeply intertwined. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I understand, of course, the practical benefits from doing such splitting. But I find it quite odd that computer people on the whole seem to think that this approach is a really elegant one. It&#39;s an idea which anyone in the humanities would find amusingly bad, one whose limitations are going to be on display constantly (as an example, witness how much hacky-looking CSS one generally needs to use in order to take a given HTML structure that was set up for a given page appearance to actually make it look totally different).

This made my day.

Jeff&#39;s site, by the way, should be on almost every Web person&#39;s radar. Once I do another nice theme for my site, I&#39;ll have to add the &#39;blog roll&#39; back on so that I can add him and Mads at least. Or, do I just put the links somewhere instead?
