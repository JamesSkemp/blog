<p>Yesterday morning I committed version 1.2 of <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/Projects/MyVideoGameTracker">My Video Game Tracker</a> to <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/JamesSkemp/MyVideoGameTrackerWP7">a public repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>At this time I intend on letting my publishing license lapse on Windows Phone development (which is still a number of months away), and have decided that I probably won't do anything further targeting Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks I'll probably also post the Madison Metro application that I was working on, warts and all. I will probably clean up the class library that I was developing, however, so someone could easily take that aspect from the project.</p>
<p>Any comments regarding the code should be left <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/JamesSkemp/MyVideoGameTrackerWP7/issues">on the issues page of the GitHub project page</a>.</p>
