<p>Last month I was playing <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006FRMVIQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention</a> on the PlayStation Vita. I had finished the game, but had started a new game and was picking up the Diez Gentleman by losing to Raspberyl.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I lost to her I kept getting the error code of C2-12828-1, and the game crashed.</p>
<p>In my particular case I just didn't have enough room in homeroom. Unfortunately I forget the exact number, but the game wants you to keep more slots open than you need. So, it's probably safer to keep 5 open chairs when fighting against Raspberyl to lose, even though you'll only pick up one new character.</p>
