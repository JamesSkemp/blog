To: All Staff<br />
From: Institutional Technology and Services (ITS)
</p>
<p>
It has come to our attention that a number of staff members are using so-called &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; passwords.
</p>
<p>
A &lsquo;secure&rsquo; password is typically defined as a password with a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters, like spaces ( ), periods (.), and punctuation marks (like &lsquo;!&rsquo; and &lsquo;?&rsquo;). An &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; password, on the other hand, is typically defined as an easily guessed word, like &lsquo;password&rsquo;, &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;help&rsquo;, various other four letter words, and the ever popular &lsquo;god&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
In order to combat this security risk, better educate our staff, and generally make things easier for the Institutional Technology and Services department, as of this coming Monday - December 28th - we&rsquo;ll be implementing a new set of corporate password policies.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, please log in with your normal user name. Your password will have been changed to &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work, Name!&rdquo;, where &lsquo;Name&rsquo; is your first name. We&rsquo;ve included two user name and password combinations below as examples.
</p>
<p>
User name: AlPreston<br />
Password: Let&rsquo;s work, Albert!
</p>
<p>
User name: JoDulo<br />
Password: Let&rsquo;s work, Joni!
</p>
<p>
Please note that you are not to enter the double quotes when you enter your password - your password should begin with an &lsquo;L&rsquo; and will end with an &lsquo;!&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Also, in order to prevent users from changing to an &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; password, we&rsquo;ll be disabling any password changes for the next three months.
</p>
<p>
Your friendly ITS System Administrators,
</p>
<p>
Albert Preston and Joni Dulo
