<p>
Google has done it again.
</p>
<p>
Logging in this evening, I immediately noticed the change to Google Analytics. Now you can see, when you first log in, the visits, average time, bounce rate, completed goals, and % change (default visits) for your sites.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s weird in that it shows a number of rows, and not sites (which effectively means half as many sites as I expect, as each of my sites has two rows), but it&#39;s very interesting.
</p>
<p>
(I&#39;m also getting a mixed content warning (secure/unsecure), but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll fix that shortly.)
</p>
<p>
The rest of the reports seem to be the same.
</p>
<p>
Very nice Google. Now if I can just get the invite to type Adsense with Analytics ...
</p>
