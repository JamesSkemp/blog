<p>
This morning Charter fixed whatever issues they were having, so I was able to purchase and download the full version of PixelJunk Eden.
</p>
<p>
I played 30 minutes this morning, and many hours this afternoon/evening. (When I&nbsp;shut down for the last time, my&nbsp;rank was 1013 - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s already changed though.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
As the demo suggested, this game is the closest thing to a masterpiece I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.
</p>
<p>
While it may not have the quantity, the Playstation Network is certainly attracting a number of quality, unique, games.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully we can luck forward to many more gardens in the future, that we can grow/explore (although I suppose that would make one of their trophies incorrect, so an upgrade would have to resolve that issue).
