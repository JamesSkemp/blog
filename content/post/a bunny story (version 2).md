<p>
There once was a bunny named cat,<br />
He was always called just that. 
</p>
<p>
When others heard he was coming,<br />
They all went a running. 
</p>
<p>
One day he was sitting,<br />
Out in a little field,<br />
Another came a running,<br />
Shouting into the field. 
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cat! Cat!&rdquo; he called.<br />
&ldquo;I&#39;m here! I&#39;m here!&rdquo; cat called. 
</p>
<p>
And the bunny cat was whole<br />
no mo&#39;e.
