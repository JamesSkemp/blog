<p>
Often times, like this morning, I&#39;ve got anywhere between 5 to 60 minutes of time to kill.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t make sense to do anything truly productive, so I end up visiting a number of sites. techmeme.com, dailyrotation.com, news.google.com, etcetera. Then I get desperate and visit weather.gov.
</p>
<p>
However, once I&#39;ve visited these, I run low on ideas of other sites, like these, that I can visit.
</p>
<p>
Any recommendations on sites that combine news, from a number of different sources, that is also interesting? I&#39;m not looking for something like smashingmagazine.com, just short and to the point. And while I will visit YouTube to kill time, I&#39;d rather do something semi-productive.

And yes, this is a filler post, of sorts.
