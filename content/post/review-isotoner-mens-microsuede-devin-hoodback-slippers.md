## Best slippers I've ever owned

In my adult life I've only owned two pairs of slippers, both within the last half decade. For whatever reason I never had much of a use for slippers in the past, but as time has gone by I've wanted a pair, more for leaving the apartment than anything else.

The first/last pair of slippers I owned were purchased at a Marshall's, or the like, and were more like a pair of shoes, with the back of the foot covered, but a thin plastic on the sole of the foot. This resulted in something that felt like a shoe, which I liked, but was thin on the bottom like a standard slipper.

Generally they worked, but the general thinness of the slipper in general meant that it got very little use.

On the other hand, the [Isotoner Microsuede Devin Hoodback Slippers][review] have a very minor back, and a thin plastic sole, but are much thicker on the sides and top, and have a very nice, thick, memory foam sole.

While I've generally had issues with shoes without a full back, seemingly because of the way these slippers are designed they generally stay on very well.

The thicker material of the slippers also make them feel much more solid, and more shoe-like, which for me means that they feel 'normal' when I'm wearing them, unlike the pair I had before that felt too light.

The memory foam soles also feel quite well, truly providing a cushioned feel.

I have used these outside, and the only issue I've had thus far is that because it's fall and there's a number of dead/dying leaves on the ground, they did stick to the outside of the slippers when I wore these outside.

For all these reasons, the [Isotoner Microsuede Devin Hoodback Slippers][review] get a full five of five stars from me. These are the best slippers I've ever owned, and come recommended.
