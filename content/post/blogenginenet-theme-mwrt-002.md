<div class="note">
<p>Updated for BlogEngine.NET 1.3!</p>
</div>
<p>Not a very original name, but I can see how it was created ...</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm proud to present another theme for BlogEngine.NET, called MWRT-002.</p>
<p>This theme is based upon the template of the same name by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/2731/" target="_blank">MyWebResource</a>, and made available on Open Source Web Design.</p>
<p>A zip of the theme can be downloaded from my testing site at JamesRSkemp.net.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.net/be_themes/MWRT-002_1.2.zip">Download the zip file - for BlogEngine.NET 1.2</a> (tested with 1.2.0.0).</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.net/be_themes/MWRT-002_1.3.zip">Download the zip file - for BlogEngine.NET 1.3</a> (tested with 1.3.0.0).</p>
