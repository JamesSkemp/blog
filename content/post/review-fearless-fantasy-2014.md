<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/282100">Fearless Fantasy</a> (2014), available for PC on Steam.</p></div>

<h3>Enjoyable, but controls are a bit iffy</h3>

<p>While Fearless Fantasy isn't long (there's only 13 sections), it's nonetheless an interesting game. The combat mechanic is probably more suited for touch-based devices (I found windowed mode makes the game a little easier, than playing full screen in 1920x1080), it still keeps combat interesting.</p>

<p>Because of the mechanic, I did find myself having to grind earlier levels for experience, and ended the game with level 17 characters. But, I still recommend it as a fun little RPG, especially if you can get it cheap.</p>

<p>Definitely enjoyed the cutscene style as well.</p>

<p>3 of 5 stars.</p>
