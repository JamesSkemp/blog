<p>I've never understood how conservatives can be anti-government, but also be for government intervention in regards to abortion, prostitution, gay/lesbian marriage/civil unions, video and movie ratings, marijuana, and etcetera.</p>
<p>Of course liberals aren't necessarily pushing hard for some of these, but see a benefit to government that doesn't include making the above illegal (and enforcing those laws) and building up the miltary.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the fact that some people are for legalizing and then taxing some of those items, and they're anti-new taxes?</p>
