<p>
Good-bye<br />
farewell<br />
my darling<br />
sweet<br />
<br />
When first we met<br />
oh<br />
so long ago<br />
you whispered sweet nothings<br />
into my ear<br />
<br />
I recall the day<br />
you wore that flowered dress<br />
that you told me that you loved me<br />
that you would be mine<br />
that I could have all<br />
I need merely ask<br />
<br />
Then one day<br />
when the birds were leaving<br />
we sat under our tree and you told me<br />
oh<br />
that fateful day<br />
that you were leaving<br />
(were you a caged bird<br />
I think not)<br />
but that I would always be on your mind<br />
<br />
Years have passed<br />
and I have aged<br />
and while I still think of you<br />
I think you think of me no more<br />
<br />
How long has it been<br />
since you have forgotten<br />
<br />
Do you still recall the time under the porch<br />
<br />
Do you still recall the time I chased you through the woods<br />
<br />
I do<br />
and always will<br />
for I am a man of memories<br />
naught but memories<br />
and tears<br />
my darling<br />
sweet
</p>
