<p>80's Linda Hamilton; sure, she did T2 in the 90s, but I bet if you think Linda Hamilton, you think 80s. Am I wrong?</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://rmlumley.com/">Rob Lumley</a> brings up Terminator 2 as being his reason he'd go with 90s Hamilton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd agree with you on the Terminator franchise, but, obviously, not with Hamilton being better in the 90s solely because of T2. Look at IMDb - <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/</a></p>
<p>TV, movies, TV, movie (T2), and then back to TV, never to return to movies (meaning non-direct to VHS/DVD).</p>
<p>'91s T2 was basically it for her, with nothing remarkable afterwards. The 80s, with Children of the Corn, Terminator, and Beauty and the Beast, were her times to shine.</p>
