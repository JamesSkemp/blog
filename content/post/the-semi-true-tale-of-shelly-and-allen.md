<p>
May 14th
</p>
<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I thank you for your kind words tonight at the Olympus Centre of the Arts. It&rsquo;s not very often I get a standing ovation, and I believe it is solely due to you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Ever since we first met, last night, I&rsquo;ve felt a strong connection to you, and this indeed fills me with great happiness.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Again, I thank you for you continued help and guidance,
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>

<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;It was indeed my pleasure to be there on the 14th, but I fear that I cannot take credit for the, well deserved, standing ovation.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Please call on me if you need anything at all,
</p>
<p>
Allen
</p>
<p>

<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You are far too humble. Had it not been for you, the night would not have gone the way it had.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
</p>
<p>
Shelly

<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I fear humbleness has little to do with it. The part I played was naught compared to what you have brought to those present.
</p>
<p>
Allen

<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You are like an innocent little boy sometimes, my dear Allen.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You really did do more than you take credit for, and you know that quite well.
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>

</p>
<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Can I really call upon you at any time Allen? I always appreciate your help, as I hope that you know.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I await your word,
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Of course I will always lend a hand when able. Do you have something on your mind? Can I assist in any way?
</p>
<p>
Allen
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
June 23rd
</p>
<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I longed to hear those words from you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I love you Allen, and must have you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Be mine forever Allen,
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You know that I would help if I could. Please tell me if you need anything.
</p>
<p>
Allen
</p>
<p>

<p>
Oh Allen, it is you that I need!
</p>
<p>
Shelly, the one who will always love you.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
July 15th
</p>
<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;As I said before, I would assist if I could. Is there nothing else you need?
</p>
<p>
Allen
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
July 16th
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Oh Allen, are you truly blind? It is you need that I need and love, like the animals and birds love and need the water and air!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Would not the mosquito die if it were not for the blood of the cow and ox, or some other, similarly blooded, animal?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Oh Allen, tell me that you love me!
</p>
<p>
Your forever love (?),
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Shelly,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I fear your last communication just reached me now, and was quite blurred. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.
</p>
<p>
Allen
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
August 30th
</p>
<p>
Allen! Can you not see that I would kill myself like the fruit fly kills itself after a late autumn gorging?
</p>
<p>
The animals, like the monkey, would cry out your name, if only they knew it, my Allen, my sweet.
</p>
<p>
You are the Adam, and I want to be the Eve - can you not see!?
</p>
<p>
Come to me, soon, my Allen, my forever Allen,
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
September 1st
</p>
<p>
Allen! Are you quite well?
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
September 1st
</p>
<p>
Allen? I have not heard from you in so many days. Please, please, let me know that you are well!
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
September 2nd
</p>
<p>
Do you do this to see if I will come back? I, like the canary, will fly back into the cage. If you let me go, I will go back, even if I must bend the bars like Mobes of Galand.
</p>
<p>
Call upon me soon, my Allen.
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>

</p>

September 10th
</p>
<p>
Allen! I am starving without you! I can only live so long, in this state of perpetual death! Come to me!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
September 11th
</p>
<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I have before me a knife, and it is covered in red, like the colour of blood.
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
September 11th
</p>
<p>
Allen,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I am killing myself right now, as I write to you.
</p>
<p>
Shelly

<p>
Did my response not elicit a single response from you?
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s always George, I suppose.
</p>
<p>
Farewell, you fool. You have truly let a fantastic woman out of your grasp.
</p>
<p>
Cordially,
</p>
<p>
Shelly
</p>
