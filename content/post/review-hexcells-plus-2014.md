<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of Hexcells Plus (2014), played on the PC.</p></div>

<h3>More of the same, with a bit more complexity</h3>

<p>Having gone through the first <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890" rel="external">Hexcells</a> rather quickly, I just as quickly started playing the standalone <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/271900/" rel="external">Hexcells Plus</a>. While this game contains the same number of puzzles as the original, it adds additional gameplay dynamics.</p>

<p>While I finished the first in less than 2 hours, Steam reports that I put in 8 hours on this version. I think I ended up letting the game run, as I don't think it required anywhere near that amount of time. However, the puzzles in this version are a bit more complex.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed the first Hexcells, you'll like this one. Since I did, and do, this game is recommended.</p>
