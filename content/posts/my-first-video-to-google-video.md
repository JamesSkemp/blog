Yesterday, I did multiple takes for a video on how to create snippets in Dreamweaver 8. The video ended up being pretty good, I think, albeit the video size was a bit large, and the resolution was a bit small (640x480 is what Google recommends).<!--more-->

<p>
It&#39;s not yet available via Google Video, but once I found out how it is available, I&#39;ll post the link/video here.

If you have any comments or recommendations about what video tutorials I should create, let me know.

EDIT: Wow. That was quick. After supplying title information, it&#39;s already Live. Note that the title and date will update at some point, since I just supplied the necessary information. Because the file was over 100 MB, I needed to use the Google Video Uploader to send my video. It looks like they&#39;ve decreased the resolution, but it doesn&#39;t look too bad at all at double size.

Again, this is Dreamweaver 8, running on Windows XP SP2.

I&#39;m using some nice Labtec headphones for the audio portions, but it&#39;s being recorded via CamStudio.
