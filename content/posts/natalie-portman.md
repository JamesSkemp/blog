<p>Is it your brown hair<br />that makes me need more air?</p>
<p>Is your tense face<br />the reason I'm lost in space?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For your sense of style<br />most would run a mile<br />not to mention your smile,<br />which makes any chore worthwhile ...</p>
<p>Every word you say<br />sounds just like the birds in May,<br />after the April showers<br />have brought forth the flowers.</p>
<p>And your divine intelligence<br />only adds to your radiance.</p>
<p>Natalie Portman thank you<br />for being you, and not Lou.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: 'Lou' refers to Captain Lou Albano.</p>
