      <title>Google Calendar access?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last 10 minutes, while downloading the latest Microsoft patches from Tuesday, I&#39;ve been trying to access Google Calendar. I&#39;m prompted to login, after a long wait, and then I wait some more, only to be sent to my Google Account page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are they limiting access to the Calendar now as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Google - it&#39;s the only search engine I use (and it&#39;s the engine most people use - for better or worse) - but they need to make sure they can handle the heavy demand&#39;s that their launches bring. I&#39;m still waiting for my Google Analytics account, so I can try that out ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of playing around in there, and since I already wrote a post for the day, I guess I&#39;ll have to take a look some more on setting up a wireless network (that&#39;s probably what I&#39;ll be spending most of my tax return on).&lt;/p&gt;
