<p>
Dear whomever,
</p>
<p>
Halo 3 sucks.
</p>
<p>
First,&nbsp;I can only play two missions (missions implying goals) at a time because there&#39;s far too much confusion after those two missions. What did I do, and why? Is there any point? Should I just go as fast through the&nbsp;map as I can? (Having done this the last two missions, it seems to work great, assuming I can find my way around, which leads me to&nbsp;...)
</p>
<p>
Second, where&#39;s the map? Is there a map? Did you hire level designers? Granted, there&#39;s an arrow, but it consistently points forwards. And that&#39;s only if you sit in one place or drive/walk around for approximately 15 minutes (give or take).
</p>
<p>
Third, no saving mid-mission. So everyone dies but me. I spend 20 minutes trying to get past something, alone. I&#39;m screwed. I restart the mission and am finally able to proceed. If you&#39;re going to make the checkpoints so messed up, at least let me save when I want, instead of having to save and quit.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, no intelligence required. Run and shoot. Go back to restore shields. Run and shoot. WTF mate?
</p>
