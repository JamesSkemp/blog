The following is a review of xinkeji's Fitbit Charge 2 Bands,Fitbit Bands Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Metal Replacement Bracelet Strap, Wristbands Accessories for Charge 2 with Stronger Magnetic Clasp, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Metal Bands are Better than Plastic
Slightly off-topic, but I'll first note that the name of this product is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not sure how they want people to actually refer to this, especially since a number of companies produce metal bands for Fitbits. For the sake of this review I'll refer to it as [xinkeji's Stainless Steel Metal Replacement bands for the Fitbit Charge 2][review].

With that out of the way, when I picked up my [Fitbit Charge 2][fitbit] in February I started developing a bit of a rash on my wrist, around where the plastic band rested. This was clearly because of either where the plastic was resting, or the plastic itself.

I started looking for replacement bands and found a number of stainless steel bands. I ultimately went with a [UMTELE Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Metal Bracelet Strap][umtele] (see, a better product name is possible).

The only issue I ran into that band was the same one I ran into this one: sometimes it would shut down my older model MacBook Pro, if I put it on my left wrist. The magnetic otherwise works just fine, and does keep the band secured to my wrist, even given that I play with it sometimes when I fidget.

I also have facial hair, and on some rare occasions I would get my mustache hair caught in the holes of the band when sleeping or otherwise getting it close to my facial hair. I can't understate how painful this can be, however it's pretty rare, and I just need to keep my wrist away from my face.

For what it is, [xinkeji's Stainless Steel Metal Replacement bands for the Fitbit Charge 2][review] doesn't really stand out from similar bands. I would highly recommend considering a metal band if you have a Fitbit, especially if, like me, your skin may have reacted to the standard plastic bands. Four of five stars.
