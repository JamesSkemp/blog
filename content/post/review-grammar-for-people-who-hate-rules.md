The following is a review of Grammar For People Who Hate Rules, written by Kathleen Watson.

## A Great Little Book to Help Improve Your Grammar and Spelling

Well over a decade ago, at my first job after college, I had the opportunity to work quite closely with writers and editors in a communications department, before my subgroup of web developers was moved over to IT.

This experience, combined with the pursuit of a philosophy degree in college, and working with editors in the years since, has lead to me having a real interest in making sure that my spelling and grammar are correct.

I found Kathleen Watson's [Grammar For People Who Hate Rules][review] to be an absolutely wonderful read, with over 120 pages of rules, tips, and quizzes, all for under $10, and considerably cheaper on Kindle. (Although I'd highly recommend the print edition for ease.)

While I've learned a number of the rules that are in this book already, there are a number of new rules, such as the interrobang (which I knew of, but neither knew the name of nor that there was a set order), which I can now add to my repertoire.

Personally, [Grammar For People Who Hate Rules][review] will definitely end up on my desk at work, where it will be easily within reach to pull out when I want to confirm proper grammar, or show a coworker why I write the way I do.

I give Kathleen Watson's [Grammar For People Who Hate Rules][review] a full five of five stars, and highly recommend it for anyone who wants to approve their writing skills.
