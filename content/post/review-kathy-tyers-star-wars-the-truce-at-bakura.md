<h3>The Empire working with the Rebellion?</h3>
<p>Written: Oct 13 '00</p>
<p>Product Rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>Pros: Easy to read and keeps you immersed.</p>
<p>Cons: You can get so caught up in the story, that time goes by so quickly!</p>
<p>I've read a lot of books, and Star Wars tends to be my favorite subject. I've read Zahn and a lot of other good authors, but I have never read any of her other books, and wasn't sure of what to expect. Kathy Tyers did not let me down. I couldn't put it down, and finished it in one day.</p>
<p>The plot was good, and all the twists and turns kept me guessing. She did a very good job keeping with the Star Wars feel of it all, and foreshadows a lot of what is to happen in the future.</p>
<p>All and a very good book. I couldn't give the book a five, because it wasn't the best book I have ever read (Zahn pops into my mind), but it is definitely up there (4.5). I highly recommend this book, even if you don't like Star Wars.</p>
