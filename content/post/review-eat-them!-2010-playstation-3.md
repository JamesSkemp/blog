<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, and released on the PlayStation Network.</p>
</div>
<p>I just recently picked up a copy of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, as it was on sale for PlayStation Plus members.</p>
<p>According to some Eat Them! is a Rampage-like game, where you control a monster that lays waste to an area of a city. Indeed, this an extremely apt description, as playing this game brought to my mind fond memories of putting quarters/tokens into the Rampage machine, and later playing it, and later releases (such as for the Nintendo 64) to mind.</p>
<p>Where this game really shines is the monster creation aspect. Each level has three goal levels. Obtaining a bronze allows you to move on, while silver and gold unlock one new monster part each (with medals stacking, so completing a level the first time with a gold unlocks two parts). The game also features a fairly robust coloring system where you can color each part separately (by default you merely select three colors for the entire monster, from a rather large array).</p>
<p>The camera is above and behind the monster, and never caused issues, since you can rotate it at will. Some of the later parts result in a truly epic monster, allowing you to quickly destory the area you've been unleashed upon. The areas are different enough that I never found them tedious, although some are used in different mission types. Unfortunately, there does seem to be one map that is only used for a bonus mission (or I just got gold on it the first time through and haven't gone back to it yet).</p>
<p>There are a number of chapters (signified by comic books in the menu), containing either missions of destruction of particular objects, destruction amounting to a certain dollar amount, racing through a map, and occassionally bonus missions like eating a number of people or returning a number of animals back to the zoo. (The last might not sound like fun, but you basically grab and fling the animals, so it's rather enjoyable.)</p>
<p>The difficulty does increase as you get near the end, so you'll need to plan accordingly, and update your monsters to deal with the task.</p>
<p>Three downsides to the game seem to be that you can't delete a monster you've created (although you can edit it) and you are not told what a particular monster part will do when added, instead you have to just try it out. Finally the menu navigation can seem a little clunky at first, but you'll get used to it. These are minor points, however, and don't detract from the actual game play experience.</p>
<p>I finished the game, 100%, over the course of 4 days, and had an absolute blast doing so. I'll certainly be keeping the game on my PS3 for those moments when I just want to wreck havoc upon a city. 5 of 5 stars.</p>
