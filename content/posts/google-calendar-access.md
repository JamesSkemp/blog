<p>For the last 10 minutes, while downloading the latest Microsoft patches from Tuesday, I've been trying to access Google Calendar. I'm prompted to login, after a long wait, and then I wait some more, only to be sent to my Google Account page.</p>
<p>So, are they limiting access to the Calendar now as well?</p>
<p>I like Google - it's the only search engine I use (and it's the engine most people use - for better or worse) - but they need to make sure they can handle the heavy demand's that their launches bring. I'm still waiting for my Google Analytics account, so I can try that out ...</p>
<p>Instead of playing around in there, and since I already wrote a post for the day, I guess I'll have to take a look some more on setting up a wireless network (that's probably what I'll be spending most of my tax return on).</p>
