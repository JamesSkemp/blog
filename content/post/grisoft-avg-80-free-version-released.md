<p>
Ever since I was told about Grisoft AVG, way back when, I&#39;ve been a heavy user. 
</p>
<p>
8.0 recently came out, but a free version wasn&#39;t available. However, I was notified today that a free version of 8.0 is now available. 
</p>

Updated May 4, 2008:&nbsp;Updated the link. They&#39;ve made it very difficult to get from the Grisoft home page to the free version&#39;s download page ...
