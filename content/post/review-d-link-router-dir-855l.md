<h3>Very nice, save the short power cord</h3>
<p>While I just replaced my router with a MediaLink router (since I wanted wireless N), when Amazon Vine offered this D-Link router I figured I would give it a try, since I had noticed issues with my laptop losing wireless and my tablet experiencing extreme drops.</p>
<p>I've now used this product for about 3 weeks and can honestly say I'm on the fence about whether I like this or my previous router more.</p>
<p>First off, after ordering this product I was expecting that the router would be warm when running, and that it would have annoying lights. I have experienced neither of these. The router doesn't feel warm at all, despite it being 70s-80s in my apartment, depending upon the day. There are also two lights, which let off my less light than any of my other networking equipment.</p>
<p>In fact, the only issues I have with the hardware is that the power cord is a little too short. It would have been nice if it had one or two more feet, since right now it's pretty tight sitting on top of a nice CD case, with the surge protector on the floor, right next to the case.</p>
<p>I also found the Web interface to be a little frustrating, as I'm more of an advanced user, and the settings I wanted to tweak were buried within options on pages, instead of having their own page. I did like the feel of the interface when I had to apply settings/restart the router; it's probably the nicest I've used.</p>
<p>This supports both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands, and I'm actually using my Samsung Galaxy S4 to connect to the 5GHz band, and have experienced no issues.</p>
<p>My laptop, Nexus 7, and Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 all use the 2.4GHz band. Compared to the MediaLink router I was using before the pings (according to SpeedTest.net) is just a bit slower. Download seems a tiny bit faster, and upload seems to be the same.</p>
<p>The range actually seems better in my apartment than my MediaLink, but I have had issues with my Xbox 360 being unable to connect at times (doesn't get an IP address). When it happens it does so right after I start it, and powering the console off and back on has always resolved the issue. Since it's getting older, I think it might be that.</p>
<p>I used a wired connection with my desktop machine, and while I didn't jot down the speeds, they too were pretty consistent with what I was getting with my previous router.</p>
<p>I have not yet used the functionality to plug in a USB drive to share files, but may in the future, and will update this review if I do so.</p>
<p>Overall, after the first couple days I was expecting that I'd hook my MediaLink back up, but now I'm not so sure. If anything, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V00K3W?tag=strivinglifen-20">D-Link Wireless N 900 Mbps Home Cloud App-Enabled Dual-Band Gigabit Router (DIR-855L)</a> may become my primary, with my MediaLink as a backup or extender.</p>
<p>4 stars merely because I would have been perfectly happy with my MediaLink, which costs much less than this does, and the power cord needs a couple more feet.</p>
