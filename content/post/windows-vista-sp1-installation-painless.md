<p>
Granted my machine came new with Windows Vista (Home Premium), but that doesn&#39;t nullify the fact that Windows Vista SP1 installation was a breeze on my business machine. 
</p>
<p>
The listing of enhancements is pretty impressive, and does much to alleviate the disappointments I had regarding certain aspects (such as the fact that SP1 supposedly changes the file copy/move functionality back to Windows XP; one of the things I really liked, once I found out about it, was that Vista doesn&#39;t keep working with the file action in the background, once the window is removed. 
</p>
<p>
Granted, I don&#39;t turn off my machines much these days (my XP machine has been up for over 28 days, 21 hours), but ... it&#39;s just one of those things that is quite nice. 
</p>
<p>
Honestly, this experience has been yet another reminder of what I (should have) learned from my philosophy courses - you can&#39;t make a true judgment regarding something until you&#39;ve actually tried it. 
</p>
<p>
Now the question is whether I upgrade to Vista Ultimate ... (very tempting since I can&#39;t use Virtual PC 2007)
