<p>
In a future tutorial I&#39;ll be walking through the setup of a database using PHP and MySQL (and possibly in the future, PHP and PostgreSQL).  To that end, I&#39;m looking for database setup requests.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Things to keep in mind:
</p>
<p>
This should be a relatively simple database, with general/widespread usage/application.  We just want to setup a table with a handful or two of columns - the closer to a hand the better.
</p>
<p>
This should be something with a use on your own computer.  Which is to say, it should be something where the sole person entering data is yourself, or those using your computer.  Obviously, since we&#39;ve installed Apache/PHP/MySQL/PostgreSQL on a local computer, there won&#39;t be many people using it from the Internet.
</p>
<p>
My fallback is to create a database that tracks gas usage and mileage for a car.  I&#39;ve already setup such a database using OpenOffice, and have been using it for a number of months, so I&#39;ll have a good deal of data I can use.
