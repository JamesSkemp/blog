<p>
Learning a program can be quite fun and rewarding, but can also be somewhat disarming. While there were a number of guides on the Internet that discussed <a href="http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/">Fractal Explorer</a>, I felt that none of them did any great service to this great program. So, I set out to create my own guide, in a format that did not force a user to view only a small amount of information at a time.
