[4 Coroner Haraway]
</p>
<p>
(A lab.)
</p>
<p>
The technician: &quot;You can come here all you want, I&#39;m not sharing this investigation. And if you&#39;re too persistent, I&#39;ll have you detained.&quot;
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
&quot;I&#39;m Togusa, Public Safety Section 9. This scary-looking fellow ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Blew her apart with double-0 buckshot. A 50 caliber hollow point would&#39;ve left her easier to reconstruct.&quot;
</p>
<!--adsense-->
<p>
&quot;She wasted 3 people, two of &#39;em cops.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;She was trying to commit suicide before you shot her. Isn&#39;t that right?&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Long pause amongst them all.)
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;&#39;Commit suicide&#39; meaning ... Miss ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Haraway.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Miss Haraway, how exactly would a robot kill itself?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;By intentionally malfunctioning, these gynoids are capable of self-authorizing attacks against humans. This liberates them from Moral Code #3.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Which stipulates, &#39;Maintain existence without injuring humans.&#39; Isn&#39;t &#39;self-destruction&#39; more accurate?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;If you assume differences between humans and machines are obvious.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Are such &#39;suicides&#39; confined to a particular model?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Not necessarily. In recent years we&#39;ve seen a surge of robot related problems, especially among the &#39;pets&#39;.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The cause?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;E-brain contamination from microbes and viruses, human production errors, functional defects from wear-and-tear. Take your pick, but ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I say it&#39;s because humans discard their robots once they&#39;re redundant. When owners trade up to newer models, some of those abandoned become vagrants, and degenerate. Perhaps it&#39;s a protest against their own obsolescence.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Absurd.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Humans are different from robots. That&#39;s an article of faith, like black isn&#39;t white. It&#39;s no more helpful than the basic fact that humans aren&#39;t machines.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Unlike industrial robots, the androids and gynoids designed as &#39;pets,&#39; weren&#39;t designed along utilitarian or practical models. Instead, we model them on a human image, an idealized one at that. Why are humans so obsessed with recreating themselves?
</p>
<p>
&quot;Do you have children?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;A daughter.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Children have always been excluded from the customary standards of human behavior, if you define humans as beings who possess a conventional identify and act out of free will. Then what are children who endure in the chaos preceding maturity? They differ profoundly from &#39;humans,&#39; but they obviously have human form. The dolls that little girls mother, are not surrogates for real babies. Little girls aren&#39;t so much imitating child rearing, as they are experiencing something deeply akin to child rearing.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;What on earth are you talking about?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Raising children is the simplest way to achieve the ancient dream of artificial life. At least, that&#39;s my hypothesis.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Children aren&#39;t dolls!&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Descartes didn&#39;t differentitate man from machine, animate from inanimate. He lost his beloved five-year-old daughter and then named a doll after her, Francine. He doted on her. At least that&#39;s what they say.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;Can we get back to reality here? I&#39;d like your observations with respect to the Hadaly robot, model #2502, manufactured by Locus Solus.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Right.
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s very well designed. I understand it&#39;s a prototype, but it&#39;s intended for particular functions.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Particular functions?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s equipped with organs unnecessary in service robots.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Meaning?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s a sexaroid. Nothing to brag about to your neighbors, but hardly illegal.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I get it. Scandal. No wonder those families settled out of court.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;When it&#39;s systems shut down, the electronic brain reformats. That&#39;s standard protection for manufacturer&#39;s proprietary software. But ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But, what?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;We found a file in the audio buffer. Care to hear it?&quot;
</p>
<p>
(She plays the file.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Help me.&quot;  (It repeats 12 and a half times before Batou stops it.)
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Thanks for your help.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;One last question. It&#39;s none of my business, but ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;No, I&#39;ve never raised a child. Nothing registered at the ovum bank.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Thank you, Miss ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Haraway. No need for Miss or Mrs.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Togusa walks away, and her eyes and part of her face raise out and up from her head.)
</p>
<p>
===
</p>
<p>
(Back to the car.)
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;She&#39;s not really the type for technical work.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Her reports are doubtless full of unsolicited opinions, just like mine.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Which probably held you back from promotion.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;We secure that gynoid&#39;s brain for the labs at Section 9.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Guess that&#39;s the last we&#39;ll see of her.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;She your type?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Actually, I like older women. What&#39;s next?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;We follow standard procedure.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Investigate the Hadaly inspector?&quot;
</p>
<p>
(From the car, a map pops up.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;09 calling 907. There&#39;s been a 602 in the District 201 boathouse. Victim is inspector for Locus Solus. Scene secured two minutes prior to local police.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Roger, 907.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Unbelievable timing.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;&#39;A fine spring day. A carriage sprints between this world and the next.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
(They drive out and off.)
