<p>
Humble reader, what is the saddest story?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On November 27 2002 I read Guy de Maupassant&#39;s <cite>Coco</cite> (as collected in <em>The Dark Side</em>). Since then I have yet to read another story as sad.
</p>
<p>
This morning I read of a farm in Wisconsin where various animals, including two miniature horses of some sort, had died. One had been stabbed (a few other animals had met there end in a similar fashion) and one had been beaten.
</p>
<p>
Here then, are two sad stories; one fictional, and one not. What do you submit?
</p>
