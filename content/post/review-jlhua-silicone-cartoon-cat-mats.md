The following is a review of JLHua Silicone Multi-Use Cartoon Cat Trivet Mat (set of 6 Pack) Insulated Flexible Durable Non Slip Hot Pads and Coasters Cup Mats.

## Yup, Grumpy Cat is Purple
We have three cats in our house so you could definitely say we're cat people. When we wanted to get new coasters to supplement what we had already I took on the task of finding some that looked cool.

This [JLHua silicone set][review] offers six different cat-shaped coasters, and seemingly would prevent the tables these are used on from both hot and cold beverages. And they definitely do.

However, unlike coasters that I tend to buy for indoor use, these are flat so any condensation that pools on them may roll off onto the table. As mentioned, we have a number of cats in the house and the bottom of these silicone coasters grabs any cat fur (and crumbs and the like) and sticks. This isn't too big of a deal, but it does require they be wiped off everyonce in a while. They also tend to stick to some surfaces more than others, and are flexible so if liquid has pooled it's slightly easier to bend the edges up.

Finally, grumpy cat was purple in our set as well. Otherwise, all the other cats were as pictured. They look good, and have held up in the three+ months that we've owned them.

I have recommended these to people that have seen and commented on how cool these are, so if you're looking for coasters and like how these look, go for it as they're recommended. Five of five stars.
