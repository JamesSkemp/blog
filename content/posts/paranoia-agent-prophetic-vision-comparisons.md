<p>
The following is a comparison of the English-spoken and English-subtitled Prophetic Vision segments of Paranoia Agent.

<div class="note">
<p>
Where differences are present, the text is parenthesized, along with either <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-e</strong>; <strong>-s</strong> means that the text is present in the subtitles, but not the spoken version, while <strong>-e</strong> means that the language is present in the spoken version, but not in the subtitles.
</p>
</div>
<p>
If someone would care to point out big differences between either English version and the true Japanese, I would be grateful.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">
Differences are only available for those episodes I have watched, which are listed below.</span> A &#39;full&#39; update history is available at the end of this page.
