The following is a review of Grifters, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Interesting Dynamic Makes for a Fun, Quick, Game

I'm familiar with the Dystopian Universe having played [The Resistance][resistance] and [Coup][coup]. However, no knowledge of the universe is required, and outside of the currency and general aesthetic, this game isn't tightly tied to the rest.

Additionally, while both The Resistance and Coup involve secret identities, [Grifters][review] instead involves recruiting characters and then using them either individually for their special abilities, or in a team to complete jobs.

With each player starting with the same three characters in hand, plus three random ones, players start out on a relatively equal footing. Over the course of the game characters are added to each players hand, with some switching control with some character abilities.

In my group this game went over very well, with people wanting to play it more than once. Being a 'hand building' game, the game plays like a deckbuilder, but without the constant reshuffling.

Personally, I really like the game, and everyone I've played it with has enjoyed the game as well. For this reason I give [Grifters][review] five of five stars. Highly recommended.
