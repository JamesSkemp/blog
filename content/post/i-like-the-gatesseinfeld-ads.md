<p>
Maybe that makes me out of it, but I like the Microsoft commercials.
</p>
<p>
No, they don&#39;t really tell me anything without digging, but they&#39;re just fun, and sometimes even funny.
</p>
<p>
Granted, they don&#39;t bash anyone like the &quot;I&#39;m a Mac&quot; commercials, but ...
</p>
<p>
Keep doing them, and I&#39;ll keep watching &#39;em.
