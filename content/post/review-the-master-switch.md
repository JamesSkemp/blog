<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307269930?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Master Switch</a>, by Tim Wu.</p>
</div>
<p>A long while back I had first read mention of this book on a blog I subscribed to, the author of whom writes about technology. He briefly mentioned the book before going on to some related discussion.</p>
<p>And that's about all I remember. He praised the book, but I can't recall why. Having now finished the book, I can honestly give it some praise as well, but I fear a repeat of what's happened in the past. Which, to some effect, rather sufficiently sums up this book on information empires.</p>
<p>In <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307269930?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Master Switch</a> Tim Wu talks us through the rise and fall of information empires - businesses built around the telephone, radio, television, movies, and the Internet - with AT&amp;T being something of the 'favored child,' in that it's brought up again and again (for good reason).</p>
<p>Tim tries to show us that each information empire rises and falls according to a sort of cycle. First the system is open wide, until it closes up as empires are built, only to fall as a new technology comes to the front.</p>
<p>Of course, the 'master switch' is also supposed to make us think of what was going on around the time of this book's publication, which was the concern of net neutrality - keeping the Internet open for all, without favor given to select providers of content, and etcetera. The title is fitting because, with perhaps the exception of the 'new' (present-day) Internet, all the previous information empires did in fact seem to develop a sort of master switch.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while it seems the book would focus rather heavily on the Internet, and that was in fact my initial understanding, that's not really the case. Because I was expecting this I did find the first half of the book to be a little slow and dis-jointed. It was rather difficult, at first, to determine why it was that he kept bouncing around (in my opinion).</p>
<p>But shortly after the half-way point the book really started to come together, with all the initial pieces starting to fall into place.</p>
<p>The ending, which I won't go into here, is debatable, since I found it to quickly slow down the ending of the book, but his points are valid (and more than a bit idealistic).</p>
<p>Altogether, though, I found the book very good, and did a great job of pulling together the historical significance of events.</p>
<p>I give the book 4 of 5 stars, since I find the book generally appealing to those who would be interested by the title, but fear that people may stop after 1/3 of the book, or so.</p>
