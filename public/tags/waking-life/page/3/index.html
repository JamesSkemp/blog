                                A lot of people like to pull full passages from Waking Life, as it&#39;s a very quotable movie. However, the problem with that is that if things change there&#39;s a whole lot of sites that are out-of-date. And, sometimes people forget to add attribution ... I&#39;ve been thinking about ways to make this easier, and believe I&#39;ve come up with an idea. Looking at the numbers, I&#39;m working from the most popular to the least popular chapters, with the goal of having all available.

Absolutely let me know if anything slipped by my look-over, especially in the quicker and the 'like, like, you know,' sections ;) Read the entire Waking Life movie transcript, with revisions.

                                Primarily Written/Added: May 14th 2003 Edited/Updated: September 18th 2003; November 10th 2003; December 11th 2003 This article is based upon Chapter 11 of Waking Life. See the complete script for Waking Life. There is more to this then the discussion about God. This is packed full with a lot of various things, all of which deserve some time. I&#39;ll start with this passage first. However, before I do that, I should point out that I&#39;m not sure whether or not these two are both film directors.
