<h3>Not Rad</h3>

<p>'RADical' ROACH is just not very enjoyable. I somehow made it through the first two levels, and recently opted to run it for a little over an hour today to just get the trading cards (which are worth next to nothing in money and gems).</p>

<p>I'm thankful I only paid 17 cents for this, thanks to a bundle.</p>

<p>2 of 5 stars, since it at least has cards, and an interesting art style. But not worth a purchase by itself.</p>
