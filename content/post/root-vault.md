Thanks to some great service yesterday, I&#39;ve successfully logged into my Vault again, and am seeing actual data.  I have a day and a half of data, but I&#39;m already quite impressed with the user interface.  I&#39;m also extremely impressed by the feedback I&#39;ve received from individuals involved in the project.

This is definitely something that I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how it develops in the near future.  They&#39;ve definitely hit on something big.
