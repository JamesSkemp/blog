The following is a review of SteelSeries Spectrum 4xB Gaming Headset for Xbox 360 (White), received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## So Many Wires, But Great With Computers

A number of years ago I received the [SteelSeries Spectrum 4xB Gaming Headset for Xbox 360][review] for review. At the time I kept putting off reviewing them since the wires kept driving me crazy when I tried to use it with my Xbox 360.

Months later I had yet to use the headphones with my 360, but had with my laptop. For this purpose the 4xB worked quite well, with a plug for the speakers and another for the mic. Sound quality of both was quite well.

I've since misplaced most of the connectors, since this includes a part that plugs into the 360 controller and then from there you plug the headphones, so I can't use it with my 360. However, I've since taken to listening to music and videos at work on my Android tablet with these, and they still work fantastic for that, feeling quite comfortable on my head and around my ears.

So when it comes to using these with an Xbox 360, there's just too many wires. But for hooking these up to listen to music, or as a laptop mic, I think they're great. For these reasons I give the [SteelSeries Spectrum 4xB Gaming Headset for Xbox 360][review] four of five stars as headphones, and two of five as a Xbox 360 headset.
