<a rel="nofollow" href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060215-6190.html" target="_blank">RIAA et al. says CD ripping, backups not fair use</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=29733" target="_blank">RIAA now says ripping is illegal</a>.

I think we&#39;re finally getting down to the basic point now.&nbsp; Is file-sharing bad?&nbsp; No (again, as I&#39;ve stressed elsewhere, p2p networks allow the sharing of more than just copyrighted material).&nbsp; Is the RIAA losing money bad?&nbsp; Looks like it.
