<p>
Over the coming months, you&#39;ll notice that the size of this area will increase.  I&#39;ll be adding a number of older articles to this area (articles from http://strivinglife.net/articles/) in the interest of creating both a standard, as well as making articles easier to find.  Since they&#39;ll be post-dated (new articles will not, of course), they won&#39;t be crowding out any current posts.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
