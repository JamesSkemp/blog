The following is a review of the Logitech G903 LIGHTSPEED Gaming Mouse with POWERPLAY Wireless Charging Compatibility, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Solid Mouse, But I Prefer My G502
Until a few years ago my last experience with a wireless mouse was with some model by HP. In addition to a poor battery life, I went through two charging stations before I finally gave up.

However, a few years ago I was given the option to take a [Logitech M310][m310] back to my work desk and give it a try. After only a couple of days I was converted, and I immediately picked up not just an M310 for home, but also a [Logitech M510][m510], so that I'd have one for home and one for my laptop bag.

Fast foward a bit and when I was building my gaming PC I decided to stick with Logitech, and picked up a [Logitech G502 Proteus][g502]. While wired, I figured for gaming I would still rather have a wired mouse, and the option to make the mouse heavier or lighter was appealing.

Fast forward to a little over a month ago, I was given the option to try out the wireless [Logitech G903][review]. However, in addition to being wireless the G903 can be plugged in via USB so that it can be used as a wired mouse, and recharged. However, since I don't get to much PC gaming these days, I instead opted to bring it into work where it would be getting a full use 5 days a week.

First, the free software is pretty much required if you want to customize the mouse's light display, which isn't too surprising. This is also the best way to find out the current charge level of the mouse, although there are three lights that will show that information as well.

To use the mouse you must use the included USB cable to either plug in the mouse or the wireless adapter. For a PC, this isn't a big deal. For a laptop, you'll want to probably look at a bluetooth-capable mouse. I personally put the adapter on the top of my desk so that I could easily charge the mouse when it was low on battery.

Speaking of which, I did have the mouse die on me once. After plugging the mouse in I was able to immediately start using it. Not having to place the mouse in a cradle to charge is fantastic.

Wired or wireless, I experienced no issues with lag. I'm a web developer, and while I use keyboard shortcuts a lot, I'm usually bouncing around web pages for debugging, starting up various applications, or clicking around as I troubleshoot. No issues at all.

The only real problem I have with the [Logitech G903][review] is how light it is. I wish it had more weight to it. And this isn't because of how much I use the G502. My mouse at work was still a M310, which is pretty light. But the G903 seems like it should be heavier. Given that it's marketed as a gaming mouse, it would be fantastic if it featured what the cheaper G502 has with modules that can be added/removed.

I'm going to continue to use the [Logitech G903][review], however, it'll stay at work and my [Logitech G502 Proteus][g502] will continue to be my PC gaming mouse.

It's for these reasons that I give the [Logitech G903 LIGHTSPEED Gaming Mouse with POWERPLAY Wireless Charging Compatibility][review] four of five stars. It's a great mouse, which I think is missing a feature that it should have for the price it has.
