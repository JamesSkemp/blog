<p>
Mustn&#39;t ... look ... too ... closely ... (already ruined one surprise)
</p>
<p>
Atlus certainly out-did themselves this time, with the Persona 4 pre-order goody. While I was expecting the &quot;Visual Data&quot; bonus to be large enough to fit behind the game&#39;s case, like the Persona 3 bonus, this one is actually graphic novel sized.

Very nice Atlus, very nice. 
</p>
<p>
And, with reviews like this, looks like we can expect a Persona 5 in the near future. 
</p>
<p>
Now it&#39;s just a question of what the soundtrack is like ... but I&#39;m too hesitant to pop that in before I start playing.

1+ hours of text and video before gameplay, here I come! (As soon as the guide gets here, of course :D) (Unless I really <em>won&#39;t</em> get it until next Monday. Come Saturday evening, I&#39;m popping it in.)
