<p>I've spent a great portion of the day researching current gen portable consoles; the Nintendo DS(i) and Sony PSP.</p>
<p>MLB for the latter was disappointing (I'm not much of a sports fan, so no surprise), but the Pokemon (I'm ashamed to admit) game was a blast.</p>
<p>If any of the stores in Madison actually carried the Metal Gear PSP bundle I would have purchased it, even though I logically have a difficult time justifying it. I think PSOne Classics and 3rd Birthday (which isn't even out until 2011) are the only things I keep consistently coming back to.</p>
<p>For variety the DS seems to be the winner, but with the 3DS coming out next year, reviewers say to hold off until then.</p>
<p>And there's no reason to purchase an iTouch when my iPod is working just fine, and I could purchase a DS and a PSP for the price I'd end up paying.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If the talk of classic Gameboy titles coming out for electronic download/purchase for the 3DS is true, as well as backwards support for DS games, I'll surely pick one of those up at some point next year, but otherwise ...</p>
