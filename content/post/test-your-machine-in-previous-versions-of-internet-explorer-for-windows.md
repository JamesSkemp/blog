In the past I believe I discussed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://browsershots.org/" target="_blank">Browsershots</a> as a great way to see what your site will look like in various browsers.

However, I was looking for a quicker way to see a particular page in IE 6. After a bit of searching, I found <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php" target="_blank">IE NetRenderer</a>. It only does Internet Explorer, but it does it extremely quick.
