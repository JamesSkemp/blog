<p>This morning I created two API wrappers for the Mashape implementations of XboxApi.com and XboxLeaders.com. These unofficial APIs allow you to pull information from Xbox Live for particular users.</p>
<p>I've used a simiilar structure for both (based upon XboxLeaders.com's PHP wrapper, since I thought I was working against there API when I was in fact working against XboxApi.com's ...), and both are available on Github.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="https://github.com/JamesSkemp/XboxLeadersWrapper">XboxLeadersWrapper</a></li>
<li><a rel="external" href="https://github.com/JamesSkemp/XboxApiWrapper">XboxApiWrapper</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In order to use these APIs you'll need to have an account on Mashape, subscribe, and <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.mashape.com/keys">generate keys</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the APIs can be found on the pages linked to from my wrappers.</p>
<p>You can also view my <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/JamesSkemp/VideoGamesSpa">Video Games SPA project on Github</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/vg/Default.html">view my implementation</a>.</p>
