The following is a review of Wickedly Prime Organic Roasted Seaweed Snacks, Korean Kalbi, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Strong in Flavor
Having already released products within their AmazonBasics brand, Amazon has started to move into the arena of food with their Wickedly Prime brand.

I've been a big sushi eater for over a decade, but about a year ago I tried [Kirkland Signature Roasted Seasoned Seaweed Winter Harvest][kirkland]. These, then, stand as the only things I can compare Amazon's [Wickedly Prime Organic Roasted Seaweed Snacks, Korean Kalbi][review] against.

I did end up bringing a few packets to work however, and one of my co-workers, who has had more experience with these, told me that "I like that you can taste the garlic and seasoning with the seaweed taste. Usually nori sheets taste 100% like nori and salt."

When I compare Kirkland's seaweed with Wickedly Prime, I agree that these are quite flavorful. Kirkland's brand was definitely salty and more than a little greasy.

Wickedly Prime's, however, has a seasoning that actually appears to me more, however, and doesn't leave my mouth thirsting for water. I would definitely purchase [Wickedly Prime Organic Roasted Seaweed Snacks, Korean Kalbi][review] over [Kirkland Signature Roasted Seasoned Seaweed Winter Harvest][kirkland]. For this reason, I give this a full five of five stars.
