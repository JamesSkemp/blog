It should be pretty self-explanatory ...

Obviously, something is up with their contact form&#39;s timestamp, or the service&#39;s.&nbsp;

Subject: Other Internet Inquiries <br />
<br />
I understand that Charter is trying to help by providing a search page if we type a domain in incorrectly, but the redirection that occurs is out of control. <br />
<br />
Even though I&#39;ve opted out via the cookie, I&#39;m still redirected to http://www11.charter.net/not_found when I type in a domain that isn&#39;t available. This is great, unless I want to try .net or .org, and have to re-type the domain name, or the entire URL. <br />
<br />
How can I get this resolved so that I&#39;ve really opted out of this feature? <br />
<br />
Thanks!

	Hi Crisjoshua, 
	</div>
	<div>
	&nbsp;I actually found that URL earlier, and it seems that my area does not yet &#39;offer&#39; that as an &#39;enhancement.&#39; 
	</div>
	<div>
	&nbsp;The issue I&#39;m having seems to be more of a hijacking, than&nbsp;an enhancement, and since I&#39;ve already verified that my area is not part of the service that the /onlineprivacy page talks about ... I&#39;m not sure that my issue has been resolved?
