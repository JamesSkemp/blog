The following is a review of AmazonBasics PlayStation 4 Controller Charging Cable, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## An Improvement Over AmazonBasics' Last Offerings

The AmazonBasics line of products has quickly become my go-to for [USB][usb-cable], [HDMI][hdmi-cable], and [digital audio][digital-cable] cables, as well as for [Nintendo 3DS/DS][3ds-case] and [tablet][tablet-case] carrying cases.

However, the last batch of USB cables I purchased for my Android devices have ended up aging quite poorly, due to what I believe is the small size of the plastic on the Micro USB end.

What I was most interested in when it came to the AmazonBasics cable for [PlayStation 4 controllers][ps4-controller] is whether they had improved this side of the cable, or if they were still working on it.

I'm happy to report that the [AmazonBasics PlayStation 4 Controller Charging Cable][review] is much more in-line with earlier versions of AmazonBasics cables, if not a little bit thicker. The Micro USB end fits quite securely into the controller, with no wiggle.

Beyond that, it's a USB cable, and it works to charge the controller. PlayStation 4's (game box) color is blue, so the cable goes quite well with the controller in that regard.

Currently the cables only come in six feet variants, so I had to hook it up to an [AmazonBasics USB 2.0 Extension Cable - A-Male to A-Female][usb-extension] that I'd previously been using with my PS4.

Compared to other AmazonBasics cables the price is a little higher, but they do seem a little sturdier for the price. For these reasons, I would not only recommend these cables in general, I'd also recommend them over the current line of AmazonBasics cables for Micro USB devices, such as Android devices, and hope this higher quality line eventually replaces their current USB cables (with additional colors available).

I give the [AmazonBasics PlayStation 4 Controller Charging Cable][review] a full five of five stars.
