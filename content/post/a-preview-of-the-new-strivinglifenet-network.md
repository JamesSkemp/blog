<p>
Instead of writing on a specific topic, which is what I wanted to do today, I&#39;ve got a preview of the new network layout.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
At this point, this will probably be &#39;the&#39; look.  I&#39;ve tested the layout in both Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Opera, and am happy with how it looks.  You&#39;ll notice, if you use Internet Explorer, that the page is not displaying correctly.  On IE, the left-side of the page will display well below the &#39;bottom&#39; of the page.  There are number of ways to fix this (and I&#39;ve had to &#39;fix&#39; something like this before), but, it&#39;s a <strong>working</strong> draft of the new layout ;)
</p>
<p>
Some links will work, and some will not.  If I update the layout, I&#39;ll be sure to post here.  While I&#39;m a fan of these particular colours, there will be the ability to change these.  At this point it&#39;s not possible, but I&#39;ve tested this functionality and have a working page with this implemented (not available at this time).
