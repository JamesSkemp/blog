      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dover Edition of &lt;a rel=&#34;external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0486217612?tag=strivinglifen-20&#34;&gt;The World as Will and Representation: Volume I&lt;/a&gt;, translated by E.F.J. Payne, suffers from a sparse table of contents, covering only the starting pages of the four books and the appendix (the index being contained in the second volume).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume One</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-The-World-as-Will-and-Presentation-Volume-One/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2008 19:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-The-World-as-Will-and-Presentation-Volume-One/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following book review is for the Richard E.&amp;nbsp;Aquila translation of Arthur Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321355784?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321355784&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The World as Will and Presentation, Volume One&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A brief history of my previous experiences with Schopenhauer: I first read Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s The World as Will and Representation (the Payne, definitive, translation) many years ago. I&amp;#39;ve also read a number of Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s other works (mostly done by Payne) and have tried to pick up as many other works of his as I can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the most part, I find that Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s philosophy most closely matched/matches my own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, I saw and picked up this translation with a bit of hesitation. The World as Will and &lt;em&gt;Presentation&lt;/em&gt;? Why go beyond Payne&amp;#39;s standard translation?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, as I read the translator&amp;#39;s introduction, I saw that my fears were unnecessary. Aquila (and probably Carus, once Volume 2 finally comes out and we can read it) have given us a truly remarkable book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aquila not only knows that Payne&amp;#39;s translations are the standards, he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to desire to change that. Instead, Aquila has presented us with a new translation, geared towards those new to Schopenhauer. In this sense, while Payne may remain the standard, definitive, translation, I see these new translations becoming the classroom standard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Errata for The World As Will and Presentation Volume One</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Errata-for-The-World-As-Will-and-Presentation-Volume-One/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 21:05:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Errata-for-The-World-As-Will-and-Presentation-Volume-One/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hello, 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I noticed a very minor mistake in Volume One of The World As Will and Presentation, translated by Richard E. Aquila. I&amp;#39;m of the tech-industry now, where errata is a necessary evil, so ... I thought I&amp;#39;d point it out, just in case any other fixes need be made in later printings/editions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;On page 396, in the last sentence of the first full paragraph, we have this text: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right the kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;This should in fact be (emphasis my own): 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right *to* kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;If this should be forwarded to someone else, please just let me know. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Thanks! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Schopenhauer&#39;s Prefaces to The World as Will and Representation</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Schopenhauers-Prefaces-to-The-World-as-Will-and-Representation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2007 15:09:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Schopenhauers-Prefaces-to-The-World-as-Will-and-Representation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) went through three editions in Schopenhauer&#39;s lifetime, and accordingly there are three prefaces, one for each edition. The first was written in 1818, the second in 1844, and the third in 1859.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;ll be looking at the preface of each of the three editions, and providing an analysis of what he has attempted to get across within each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Page count of the first, second, and third edition prefaces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before looking at each preface by itself, there is one simple thing we can first do. By comparing the three prefaces, one thing is readily apparent; the size of the prefaces changed a good deal from one to the next. Looking at the translation&#39;s published by Dover Publications, the first preface is six pages, the second ten, and the third just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the questions we will ask, the one we must make sure we answer is what this signifies. Why is it that the number of pages changed so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The first edition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In relation to Schopenhauer&#39;s life&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date of the preface to the first edition is written as August 1818. Born in 1788, Schopenhauer would have been around 30 years of age at the writing of this preface, and by this time had released two works; &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), in 1813, and &lt;cite&gt;On Vision and Colors&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber das Sehn und die Farben&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in 1816.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first edition of &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt; consisted solely of the first volume of the work. The second volume would not be included until the second edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Preface to the first edition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schopenhauer sets out to do one thing in the preface to the first edition of &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt;, but through this one thing, actually does two other things. We need look no further than the first sentence to see what he sets out to do;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I purpose to state here how this book is to be read, in order that it may be thoroughly understood.&amp;rdquo; [xii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;rsaquo;Wie dieses Buch zu lesen sei, um m&amp;ouml;glicherweise verstanden werden zu k&amp;ouml;nnen, habe ich hier anzugeben mir vorgesetzt.&amp;lsaquo; [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, he sets forth three demands upon the reader who would pick up his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first demand is that the reader read his book twice, the first time with great patience. [xii-xiii] Schopenhauer argues that this is absolutely necessary, as &amp;ldquo;the beginning presupposes the end almost as much as the end the beginning, and that every earlier part presupposes the later almost as much as the later the earlier.&amp;rdquo; [xiii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moreover, the earnest desire for fuller and even easier comprehension must, in the case of a very difficult subject, justify occasional repetition.&amp;rdquo; [xiii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second demand is that two of his works be read before this one; &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt; and the first chapter of &lt;cite&gt;On Vision and Colors&lt;/cite&gt;. [xiii-xiv] As already stated, these were nothing more than the two works he had already released, and which he calls in this preface his introduction to this new work. Please note that my piece &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2005/06/01/64/arthur-schopenhauers-principle-of-sufficient-reason/&#34;&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer&amp;rsquo;s Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/a&gt; covers this book in some detail, at least as regards the four roots, or laws, of the principle of sufficient reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s truly interesting is that Schopenhauer states that he would have preferred incorporating both works into this new one - the first with some corrections, and the second word for word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one might argue arrogance at this point - and indeed they may not be too wrong - what&#39;s really important is that Schopenhauer sees his three writings as one whole work. If, as we must, we rely solely on what he wrote here, then we get the impression that, were time not a factor, he would have incorporated this thoughts into this single volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to the third demand, he requires that the reader have an acquaintance with the principal works of Kant. [xv-xvi] In addition to this, he requires that the appendix, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy (&lt;span&gt;Kritik der Kantischen Philosophie&lt;/span&gt;) be read &amp;ldquo;as its subject-matter has special reference to book one of the present work.&amp;rdquo; [xv] Of course, like the main work, the appendix should also be read twice. Yet, if we read him correctly, this is perhaps his only writing that he would not want incorprated into main work, as he has specifically made it a separate appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schopenhauer also ties in additional works, namely Plato&#39;s and the &lt;cite&gt;Vedas&lt;/cite&gt;, specifically the &lt;cite&gt;Upanishads&lt;/cite&gt;, and states that if the reader has read these works, they will be better prepared to hear what Schopenhauer has to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those that would not meet these demands, Schopenhauer has very little to say. He&#39;s willing to wait for those who will come to his work having meet these demands, and for the rest, they can either review it nonetheless, which is the best course, or use the book for other purposes (including filling a gap in one&#39;s library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closes the preface by stating that he&#39;s &amp;ldquo;confident that, sooner or later, it will reach those to whom along it can be addressed.&amp;rdquo; [xvii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The second edition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In relation to Schopenhauer&#39;s life&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date listed in the preface to the second edition is February 1844, almost twenty-six years after the previous preface. Now approximately 56, Schopenhauer has released three additional writings; &lt;cite&gt;On the Will in Nature&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber den Willen in der Natur&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), in 1836, and &lt;cite&gt;On the Basis of Morality&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Grundlage der Moral&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;cite&gt;On the Freedom of the Will&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Freiheit des Willens&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), both released in 1841.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the second edition that Schopenhauer adds the additional volume to &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt;, and makes small changes to the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Preface to the second edition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schopenhauer&#39;s preface to the second edition begins with an introduction to why he is writing this work, something that he only alluded to in his first preface. In the first he states that the book attempts to impart a single thought, and hence the true necessity of reading the work twice. In the second, he states that he is writing his work for mankind, confident that one day they will be able to see beyond &amp;ldquo;the false and the bad, [&amp;hellip;] the absurd and the senseless.&amp;rdquo; [xviii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, this edition&#39;s preface is the longest of the two, and it does not take us too long to see why, for in this preface he writes a good deal on how he sees current philosophy in Germany. In fact, only two and half pages of the preface deal with what has changed since the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he explains why he has choosen to add a second volume to the work, instead of incorporating these changes into the first volume. [xxi-xiii] &amp;ldquo;This I have done because I wanted to guard against spoiling the work of my earlier years by the carping criticism of old age.&amp;rdquo; The second volume is to be read only after the first has been read, and during the second reading. Yet, if one is not going to read the first volume again, Schopenhauer states that the second should still only be read after the first has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He assumes that the first edition&#39;s preface will have already been read, for he makes mention to it in these pages, reiterating that knowledge of Kant is presupposed. Yet, he goes even further to state that this knowledge must be from an actual reading of the work, and not second-hand knowledge. &amp;ldquo;The man who imagines he can become acquainted with Kant&#39;s philosophy from the descriptions of others, labours under a terrible mistake.&amp;rdquo; [xxiv] And further, &amp;ldquo;it is true of him in the highest degree, as indeed of all genuine philosophers, that only from their own works does one come to know them, not from the accounts of others.&amp;rdquo; [xxiv]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the rest of the preface, which speaks on the current affairs of philosophy. He attacks Hegel and others who, in the current philosophical movement, across Germany and Europe, persue philosophy with material interests in mind, whether they be personal, official, ecclesiastical, or political.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pretend philosophers will receive no accomodations from Schopenhauer, for there efforts will not find the truth. On the contrary, anything that does not comply with their purposes and intentions will be condemned and given no consideration, or otherwise suppressed, no matter it&#39;s true value. [xix-xx]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that Schopenhauer takes particular aim at the professors of philosophy, for they must make their living, yet deal with &#34;a thousand considerations,&#34; for they must consider &#34;the fear of the Lord, the will of the ministry, the dogmas of the established Church, the wishes of the publisher, the encouragement of students, the goodwill of colleagues, the course of current politics, the momentary tendency of the public, and Heaven knows what else.&#34; [xxvi]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, one who follows the maxim &lt;em&gt;primum vivere, deinde philosophari&lt;/em&gt; (first live, then philosophize) is driven only by philosophy itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is these discussions, on the state of philsophy in the world, that drive the size of this preface up, which otherwise would have been of a length shorter than the first, but longer than the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The third edition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In relation to Schopenhauer&#39;s life&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date listed in the preface to the third edition is September 1859, over fifteen years since the second, and more than forty-one years since the first. Now in his seventy-second year, he has released all of his writings that he will release, which include a revision to &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt; in 1847, and the two volumes of &lt;cite&gt;Parerga and Paralipomena&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Parerga und Paralipomena&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in 1851.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Preface to the third edition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The true and the genuine would more easily obtain a footing in the world, were it not that those incapable of producing it were at the same time pledged not to let it gain ground. [&amp;hellip;] For me the consequence of this has been that although I was only thirty years of agewhen the first edition of this book appeared, I live to see this third edition not until my seventy-second year.&amp;rdquo; [xxviii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this preface, the shortest of the three, that hear satisfactation in Schopenhauer&#39;s voice, for it is at the end of his life that his influence on philosophy truly begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, although &lt;cite&gt;Parerga and Paralipomena&lt;/cite&gt; have been released separately, he tells us that these writings, especially those in the second volume, would have been included within &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt;, were it not for question of how much time he had left. Yet, that has not stopped him from adding &amp;ldquo;136 pages&amp;rdquo; to the current work. [xxviii]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.F.J. Payne&#39;s translation of &lt;cite&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/cite&gt; (published by Dover Publications) was used for all English-version quotes, and page numbers for English text therefore refer to the first volume of this version. &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.com/words/post/English-language-books-by-or-on-Arthur-Schopenhauer.aspx&#34;&gt;Read more about the English translations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German quotes and titles were pulled from &lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;S&amp;auml;mtliche Werke&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, published by Suhrkamp. Page numbers for German quotes therefore refer to pages from the first book of this collection. &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Arthur-Schopenhauers-books-in-Samtliche-Werke.aspx&#34;&gt;Read more about the German books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In this article, I&amp;#39;ll be covering the five books that compose the German &lt;span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;S&amp;auml;mtliche Werke&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, published by Suhrkamp. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;S&amp;auml;mtliche Werke&lt;/span&gt; consists of the following five books;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kleinere Schriften&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber das Sehn und die Farben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber den Willen in der Natur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Freiheit des Willens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Grundlage der Moral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parerga und Paralipomena I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parerga und Paralipomena II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits over the English versions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The major benefit of the German editions of Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s works is the fact that these German editions can be bought as part of a collection from a single publisher. The English editions, on the other hand, range from (for those done by the great E. F. J. Payne) Dover to Cambridge to Oxford and beyond. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not only does this mean that you&amp;#39;re bookshelf is going to look off, it also means that there&amp;#39;s no one index that covers all of the works. Not the case with this German edition. The five books are the same size and style, and the fifth book contains a full index of the collection. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The compact size also means that&amp;#39;s far easier to move these books around. Unfortunately, the margins are a bit small, which means you&amp;#39;ll be limited more than usual on how much you can write in the margins. Line-spacing too is an issue, which means you&amp;#39;ll be pushing it if you try to underline a line more than once. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this German edition, you&amp;#39;re looking at approximately 4,150 pages over the five books (~731 + 925 + 872 + 622 + 998). Of course, you have to know German ... 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holidays and birthdays</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Holidays-and-birthdays/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2006 09:24:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Holidays-and-birthdays/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My birthday happens to be today, and when I started checking my email this morning, I was presented with 4 different birthday greetings, from 4 different forums.  I&amp;#39;m aware that forums have been doing this for a long time, so what struck me is the forums I signed up for, but don&amp;#39;t remember doing so :D  (That&amp;#39;s also a little security-scary&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;link1&#34; name=&#34;link1&#34; href=&#34;#note1&#34; title=&#34;link1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I know I&amp;#39;m signed up with many more that don&amp;#39;t appear to be sending birthday greetings.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about the worth of a good deal of holidays, especially when it comes to gifts.  This year, we&amp;#39;re going to spend little - hopefully nothing - on Christmas, and more on birthdays.  We&amp;#39;re doing this for a number of reasons.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, Christmas time is a usually the worst time to be shopping, since it&amp;#39;s so busy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, after doing all of that shopping, there&amp;#39;s no time to enjoy either the season or the gifts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, not every family can get together for every birthday - it&amp;#39;s easier to get together for just one day, even if it is the busiest day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third, birthdays mean more.  We&amp;#39;re not a religious family - they believe in some God, and I&amp;#39;m a Schopenhauerian&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;link2&#34; name=&#34;link2&#34; href=&#34;#note2&#34; title=&#34;link2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - so Christmas for us, and for a vast majority of the American people (no matter what faith they may say they believe in) is just another day we&amp;#39;re off from work, and one that tradition says must be filled with good food and gifts - like Thanksgiving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the emails I received today, this was a great feature of the board&amp;#39;s software.  Not only do a get a generic birthday greeting, but more importantly, I get a reminder of my involvement in the board.  Some of these four I&amp;#39;m not going to be checking up on, but at least 2 I will be, since my interest has grown in said areas (they are more techie boards).  It&amp;#39;s been a while, and I&amp;#39;d like to see just how they&amp;#39;ve grown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I checked into was a Wordpress plugin for this as well.  However, Wordpress users don&amp;#39;t currently enter a birthday.  So, it would involve creating another field for the user, and then creating a notification if it&amp;#39;s the user&amp;#39;s birthday.  It could be totally optional, but may just bring readers closer to a site, or at least give them a reminder on a good day to do so.  After all, there are few days as personal as the day of one&amp;#39;s birth (which, thereby, could be number four for the list above).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a id=&#34;note1&#34; name=&#34;note1&#34; href=&#34;#link1&#34; title=&#34;note1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: Security-scary simply because it&amp;#39;s another way to find out personal information about me.  Of course, these days Google will give you everything you need to know about a person - and I don&amp;#39;t mind.  I want people to be able to do a search for me and find out how to contact me.  You never know ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a id=&#34;note2&#34; name=&#34;note2&#34; href=&#34;#link2&#34; title=&#34;note2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;: As in, I find Arthur Schopenhauer to have a good stand on life.  Whether that requires a God is questionable indeed, since, in a way, the Will is a kind of standard god (lowercase intentional).  I&amp;#39;m not sure whether Schopenhauerian is the correct term or not ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Update: May 14, 2006 @ 9:32 am&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One note that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into this is that Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day and Father&amp;rsquo;s Day appear to be more Hallmark Days than anything, much like Secretary&amp;rsquo;s Day, and etcetera. These &amp;lsquo;Day&amp;rsquo;s are only necessary because we forget that these people should be thanked on a regular basis, not for doing their &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo;, but also for just being who they are - someone close to us, or someone who provides some assistance to us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, as with Christmas, having a specific day helps draw attention, on a large/national scale. So, there&amp;rsquo;s some benefit to it, however, too much consumerism is a bad thing - is it better to show how much you appreciate the Secretary by buying her a gift, or do you thank her in other ways?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Of course, now that the day exists, the Secretary, if smart, will want that material aspect to it, perhaps in the form of a bonus, or better in my opinion, a raise.)
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s Principle of Sufficient Reason</title>

Description: A brief article regarding Arthur Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s principle of sufficient reason, discussed in his work On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Created: January 21st - 22nd 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Modified: February 6th 2004; June 14th 2004; April 27th 2005; June 1st 2005
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Notes: See also my papers titled: &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2003/10/23/213/schopenhauers-relationship-with-aesthetic-contemplation-and-asceticism/&#34;&gt;Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s Relationship with Aesthetic Contemplation and Asceticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2004/06/17/259/heideggers-principle-of-reason-lectures/&#34;&gt;Heidegger&amp;#39;s Principle of Reason Lectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;; &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2004/06/12/260/overview-of-leibnizs-the-principles-of-philosophy-or-the-monadology/&#34;&gt;Overview of Leibniz&amp;#39;s The Principles of Philosophy, or, the Monadology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Arthur Schopenhauer is an extremely self-referential philosopher, perhaps the most self-referential of all the great philosophers. Yet, this is due primarily to the fact that Schopenhauer is one of the few philosophers that sticks with one system throughout his life - throughout his writings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sole purpose of this article is to explain, as briefly and compactly as possible, Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s principle of sufficient reason, as I understand it, for those who have not read the bulk of his works. Of course, this article will in no way be able to substitute for Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s works, especially his essay &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt;, but it is my hope that this article will be able to shed some light on this principle, as a guide for reflection upon the aforementioned essay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many great things about Arthur Schopenhauer, besides the fact that he is consistent - as the fact that he is extremely self-referential implies. Schopenhauer finds the need, and rightly so, to define words that he makes the use of. &amp;quot;I regard the greatest possible comprehensibility, to be attained by an accurate definition of every expression, as the absolutely necessary prerequisite for philosophy.&amp;quot; [1: 4] In addition, Schopenhauer finds the time to, very systematically, sum up what he says, not only within the main body of his essays, but also at the conclusion of each. When one combines these two facts together, it comes as no surprise that we can find a good definition of the principle of sufficient reason in the concluding chapter of &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt;. &amp;quot;The general meaning of the principle of sufficient reason may [...] be reduced to the fact that always and everywhere each thing exists merely by virtue of another thing.&amp;quot; [1: 232] Or, stated differently, as he does in the first chapter of his work, the principle of sufficient reason states, &amp;quot;nothing is without a ground or reason why it is.&amp;quot; [1: 6] These definitions back up Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s other claim that this principle is the &amp;quot;fundamental principle of all knowledge&amp;quot; [1: 2] and &amp;quot;the basis of all science.&amp;quot; [1: 5]  After all, this principle applies to every thing, and explains why every thing exists; if nothing existed then we could know nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having stated the general principle, it is now possible to deal with some of the specifics of the principle. The first thing that Schopenhauer finds necessary to discuss is the ways that others have used this principle, so as to show some important considerations. Yet, while it is not all that he does, Schopenhauer finds more to say about the errors in the principle&amp;#39;s application, then about those who used it correctly. But, one should not read this as saying that Schopenhauer merely attacks others, as this is in no way the case. Rather, sometimes it&amp;#39;s important to first clear away the misconceptions of a theory, rather then build upon those misconceptions, and then clear them away later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, as was said above, Schopenhauer first deals with previous misconceptions regarding the principle of sufficient reason. The first misconception is the use of the word &amp;#39;cause&amp;#39; to explain a great variety of different things. There is a &amp;quot;highly important distinction between a ground or reason of knowledge and a cause.&amp;quot; [1: 11] Schopenhauer goes into great detail in discussing this distinction, but his conclusions can be summed up as the following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Knowing and demonstrating that a thing exists&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;the ground or reason of knowledge.&amp;quot; [1: 11] &amp;quot;Knowing and proving why it exists&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;knowledge of the cause.&amp;quot; [1: 11] This distinction is also stated when Schopenhauer points out that there is &amp;quot;a clear distinction between requiring a reason of knowledge in support of a judgement and requiring a cause for the occurrence of an actual event.&amp;quot; [1: 13] It is also worth pointing out that Schopenhauer believes that a ground of knowledge does not &amp;quot;at once lead to something further&amp;quot; while a cause does. [1: 14] This is due to the fact that Schopenhauer believes that the law of causality is always at work - that change is constantly occurring, or taking place (my own words, not per se his). On last quote of the distinction, before we move on, could certainly not hurt in our understanding. Quoting Kiesewetter, we find that Schopenhauer agrees with the statement that &amp;quot;&amp;#39;logical ground or reason (reason of knowledge) is not to be confused with the general ground or reason (cause)&amp;#39;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&amp;#39;the former is the fundamental principle of thought, the latter that of experience.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; [1: 30]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we continue, it is worthwhile to point out how one can demonstrate that the principle of sufficient reason is true. &amp;quot;Now whoever requires a proof for this principle, i.e., the demonstration of a ground or reason, already assumes thereby that it is true; in fact he bases his demand on this very assumption. He therefore finds himself involved in that circle of demanding a proof for the right to demand a proof.&amp;quot; [1: 33]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that the basics of the principle of sufficient reason have been mentioned, we can discuss the outcroppings of the principle. As the title of the aforementioned essay suggests, the principle of sufficient reason is of four &amp;#39;roots&amp;#39;. The first is the principium rationis sufficientis fiendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of becoming. The second is the principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of knowing. The third is the principium rationis sufficientis essendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of being. The fourth is the principium rationis sufficientis agendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of acting. Each of these four roots of the principle of sufficient reason has a full chapter devoted to them within &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each of these four roots can also be summed up by a &amp;#39;law&amp;#39;, if you will. The first relies upon the laws of causality, the second upon the laws of &amp;#39;judgement&amp;#39;, the third upon the laws of &amp;#39;position and succession&amp;#39;, and the fourth upon the laws of motivation. Those laws within single quotes are my own, while those without are stated by Schopenhauer himself. As stated above, each of these four roots gets a chapter devoted to them, but they can be summed up fairly well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first root, the principium rationis sufficientis fiendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of becoming, states that &amp;quot;if a new state of one or several real objects appears, another state must have preceded it upon which the new state follows regularly, in other words, as often as the first state exists.&amp;quot; [1: 53] The new state mentioned above is also known as the effect, while the preceding state is also known as the cause. Therefore, every effect has a cause.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second root, the principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of knowing, states that &amp;quot;if a judgement is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason.&amp;quot; [1: 156] To put this into words similar to the first root, every true judgement - every judgement that expresses a piece of knowledge - precedes from a sufficient ground or reason. Schopenhauer breaks this root into four other parts, namely truths, but we need not do more than mention the name of each of the four kinds. The four kinds of truths are; logical, empirical, transcendental, and metalogical (and are covered on pages 157 to 163 of the referenced text).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The third root, the principium rationis sufficientis essendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of being, is difficult to wrap up quickly, but I believe it can be stated the best by the statement that &amp;quot;space and time are so constituted that all their parts stand in mutual relation and, on the strength of this, every part is determined and conditioned by another.&amp;quot; [1: 194] Later, he calls this principle &amp;quot;the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&amp;quot; [1: 194] Schopenhauer calls our attention to the various fundamental proofs within geometry for examples of this principle. His first example of this was actually stated earlier in the work, and deals with a triangle that contains two equal angles. Based on this, it necessarily follows that the sides opposite of these angles are equal. As I mean only to attempt to bring the basics of his thoughts out here, I can in no way substitute for the part of his work where he discusses this, so I call your attention to the whole of chapter six for more information regarding this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fourth root, the principium rationis sufficientis agendi or principle of sufficient reason or ground of acting, deals solely with, for each individual, &amp;quot;only one object, the immediate object of the inner sense, the subject of willing.&amp;quot; [1: 207] The law mentioned above related to this root is the law of motivation. Schopenhauer compares the law of motivation and the law of causality - and therefore the fourth root with the first root - by saying that &amp;quot;motivation is causality seen from within.&amp;quot; [1: 214] In other words, motivations can bring about acts in much the same way that physical objects can - while I may not be enslaved by chains, I could be enslaved by thoughts which act upon me much like chains. Schopenhauer calls the reader&amp;#39;s attention to his essay On the Freedom of the Will, and I too call your attention to it, as this root is so closely linked to this essay that one can not fully grasp this without that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we leave these roots, and see how the various sciences take them up, it&amp;#39;s important to touch upon the necessity implied by each of the above four roots. As above, as well as from Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s essay On the Freedom of the Will, we see that the principle of sufficient reason necessarily implies necessity over all that it applies to, and therefore to all of reality. In his chapter of general remarks, we see this discussion of necessity, as well as a systematic layout of each of the four roots, which I now present here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Accordingly, there is a fourfold necessity corresponding to the four forms of the principle of sufficient reason. (1) Logical necessity, according to the principle of sufficient reason of knowing, by virtue whereof, when once we have admitted the premises, the conclusion must be admitted without question. (2) Physical necessity, according to the law of causality, by virtue whereof, as soon as the cause has appeared, the effect cannot fail to appear. (3) Mathematical necessity, according to the principle of sufficient reason of being, by virtue whereof every relation, stated by a true geometrical theorem, is as that theorem affirms it to be, and every correct calculation remains irrefutable. (4) Moral necessity, by virtue whereof every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character.&amp;quot; [1: 226-227]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before I leave this subject, it&amp;#39;s interesting to take these four roots of the principle of sufficient reason and see how they apply to actual things in the world. The ground of being has its place in &amp;quot;pure mathematics&amp;quot;. [1: 230-231] The ground of becoming has its place in &amp;quot;physics, chemistry, geology&amp;quot;, etcetera. [1: 231] The ground of knowing is of particular use in those sciences that by their nature rely upon classification, such as &amp;quot;botany, zoology, mineralogy&amp;quot;, etcetera. [1: 231] Finally, the ground of acting can be found in &amp;quot;history, politics, pragmatic psychology&amp;quot;, etcetera, and perhaps, taken slightly differently, ethics. [1: 231]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are the basics of Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s work - &amp;quot;nothing is without a ground or reason why it is&amp;quot; [1: 6] - this is the principle of sufficient reason in just some of its glory. Yet, as I said before, this all-to-brief look at his work, &lt;cite&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/cite&gt;, should in no way be used as a substitute for his work, merely as one guide amongst many.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re going to read more on Arthur Schopenhauer, I suggest you start with his main works, followed by other primary resources (id est, books written by him), followed by secondary resources. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For ease, I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of books currently available to the English language reader. Obviously, if you can read German, it makes little sense to purchase any of the translations, since the language the work was written in is better suited for Schopenhauer&amp;rsquo;s original thoughts. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For translations, I highly recommend those done by E. F. J. Payne, who is by far the most cited translator (from what I can tell from experience). While a number of other translations exist, browsing through them has left me unnecessarily flustered, due to their unnecessary complications. Schopenhauer is easy to read in German, and should be easy to read in English.&lt;!--adsense--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as a German version for the United States, I&amp;#39;ve purchased the five book &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FS%25e4mtliche-Werke-Bd-Arthur-Schopenhauer%2Fdp%2F3518097377&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;S&amp;auml;mtliche Werke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. A couple of the books are available individually, but not the full five book set. All five books will set you back around $120. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first book(s) you&amp;rsquo;ll want to purchase is &lt;em&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/em&gt;, often cited as &lt;em&gt;The World as Will and Idea&lt;/em&gt;. This work is composed of two volumes, Volume I and Volume II. The first volume is the main work, and the second is an expansion of Volume I. Volume II also includes the index to Volume I, making the purchase of the second somewhat important. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FWorld-As-Will-Representation-1%2Fdp%2F0486217612%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1157390746%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;The World as Will and Representation, Volume I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FWorld-As-Will-Representation-2%2Fdp%2F0486217620%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1157390746%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;The World as Will and Representation, Volume II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schopenhauer also has another piece, &lt;em&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/em&gt;, which should really be read first. However, since most college courses that look at Schopenhauer use &lt;em&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/em&gt;, this piece should definitely be read next. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FFourfold-Principle-Sufficient-Library-Philosophy%2Fdp%2F0875482015%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1157391383%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please note that my piece &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2005/06/01/64/arthur-schopenhauers-principle-of-sufficient-reason/&#34;&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer&amp;rsquo;s Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/a&gt; covers this book in some detail, at least as regards the four roots, or laws, of the principle of sufficient reason. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following this, we have the shorter pieces that Schopenhauer submitted to two Royal Societies of Sciences as answers to particular questions. &lt;em&gt;Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will&lt;/em&gt;, submitted to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences, was awarded the prize essay to the question. &lt;em&gt;On the Basis of Morality&lt;/em&gt;, submitted to the Royal Danish Society of Scientific Studies, was not awarded the prize, even though it was the only entry. Both of these works deserve a reading. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FSchopenhauer-Freedom-Cambridge-History-Philosophy%2Fdp%2F0521577667%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1157391305%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will: Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FOn-Basis-Morality-Arthur-Schopenhauer%2Fdp%2F0872204421%2Fsr%3D1-10%2Fqid%3D1157391090%2Fref%3Dsr_1_10&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;On the Basis of Morality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following this, we have &lt;em&gt;Parerga and Paralipomena&lt;/em&gt;, which consist of two separate volumes. The first is composed of six long essays, while the second is composed of thirty-one short essays. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FParerga-Paralipomena-Short-Philosophical-Essays%2Fdp%2F0199242208%2Fsr%3D1-5%2Fqid%3D1157391090%2Fref%3Dsr_1_5&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;Parerga and Paralipomena: Volume 1: Six Long Philosophical Essays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2FParerga-Paralipomena-Short-Philosophical-Essays%2Fdp%2F0199242216%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fqid%3D1157391208%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;Parerga and Paralipomena: Volume 2: Short Philosophical Essays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are, finally, a number of translations that are currently out of print, or unavailable (at least, I have been unable to find them &amp;ndash; any assistance in procuring these books would be extremely helpful and welcome). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuscript Remains&lt;/em&gt;, consisting of four volumes (as of approximately August 2008, available through Berg Publishing)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Will in Nature&lt;/em&gt; (translated by E. F. J. Payne)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Vision and Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cornell University recently (January 2007) released &lt;em&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;On the Will in Nature&lt;/em&gt; as one volume, taken from the Cornell University Library Digital Collections. The works are translated by Karl Hillebrand, and the actual volume quality is generally &amp;#39;eh.&amp;#39; However, I include it here, since it&amp;#39;s available for both purchase (eh) or online. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2Ffourfold-principle-sufficient-reason-nature%2Fdp%2F1429739630%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fqid%3D1157391208%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_2&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;For purchase, through Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We next have secondary works, or works on Schopenhauer. My reading of these has been sparse, however, I do have a couple books, which I include here. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A further listing is quite possible, but as most should know, a reading of secondary works is nothing compared to a reading of primary works. After reading a number of his primary works, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon have quite a collection of secondary resources to peruse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chronological listing of works by Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 - 1860):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On Vision and Colors (1816)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The World as Will and Representation (1818)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;On the Will in Nature (1836)&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;On the Basis of Morality&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;On the Freedom of the Will&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;Uuml;ber den Willen in der Natur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Freiheit des Willens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preisschrift &amp;uuml;ber die Grundlage der Moral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parerga und Paralipomena I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Starting from the truth that &amp;quot;the world is my representation&amp;quot; [3], Arthur Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The World as Will and Representation&lt;/em&gt; lays down what Schopenhauer believes the world is. After determining that the world is not only representation, but also will, he goes on to discuss how this all works together, and how other philosophers work into this system. For this paper, I will be focusing on the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism within this work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before I can discuss the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism, I must first determine what each is for Schopenhauer. Asceticism is denial of the self, and the body. An ascetic cares neither about suffering, nor pleasure. Aesthetics, on the other hand, deals with art, such as paintings and sculpture. Aesthetic contemplation, then, would be contemplation, or examination, of art. Schopenhauer argues that aesthetic contemplation should specifically look for &amp;quot;knowledge of the object not as individual thing, but as Platonic &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, or as the eternal form of the thing - what all like things share. [195]&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having explained the basics of these two terms, we can now investigate what the relationship between the two is for Schopenhauer. If we continue with the quote above, we see that Schopenhauer begins to lay it out for us. Schopenhauer&amp;#39;s aesthetic method consists of two things; &amp;quot;knowledge of the object not as individual thing, but as Platonic &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, as stated above, and &amp;quot;the self-consciousness of the knower, not as individual, but as &lt;em&gt;pure, will-less subject of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; [195] That is, his method consists of seeing the perceived object - a painting for example - not only as representing a Platonic Idea, but also without relation to the perceiver - outside of the principle of sufficient reason.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an attempt to clarify, and to showcase what I believe Schopenhauer is saying, imagine a landscape painting by some famous artist. In this painting we see a meadow, mountains off in the background, a darkening sky, and a few clumps of trees. While this painting may represent - may have been inspired by - some particular plot of land that the artist has seen, the painting should not inspire that kind of feeling into us. Rather, we should look at it as showcasing the Platonic Ideas of those objects within the painting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a similar way, we should not portray our selves into the painting, imagining that we are, for example, sitting in the meadow drawn, or walking towards the mountains/trees painted, but, rather, should forget that we are, and contemplate solely those Platonic Ideas that the painting shows us. It is, therefore, by aesthetic contemplation that we can become ascetics, denying the self, and not allowing it to move us, allowing only the art to do so, or perhaps, only the Platonic Ideas to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Schopenhauer details this further when he tells us that &amp;quot;when ... an external cause or inward disposition suddenly raises us out of the endless stream of willing ... the attention is now no longer directed to the motives of willing, but comprehends things free from their relation to the will. Thus it considers things without interest, without subjectivity, purely objectively.&amp;quot; [196] Like an ascetic, the perceiver becomes &amp;quot;lost in the object, forgetting all individuality&amp;quot; or all sense of a self, of a body, while in aesthetic contemplation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is worth noting that the self is, as a manifestation of the will, will, and therefore striving. What the will strives towards is that which applies directly to it, which will attempt to fulfill its desires, but which will instead only bring about the arousal of new desires, of new things towards which the will will strive towards. Only by contemplating the Ideas, through aesthetic contemplation, can we be free of this striving, by losing our self in the Ideas, or perhaps equally true, the moment. It&amp;#39;s also important to state here that philosophy, according to Schopenhauer, &amp;quot;can never do more than interpret and explain what is present and at hand.&amp;quot; [271] This ties into this because we are not concerned with how it effects us - the events that will lead from what we are contemplating, which is covered under Etiology - but rather solely with what it is presenting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Music is another part of this, both in so far as it is an art, and is therefore open to aesthetic contemplation, as well as in so far as it allows us to attend to things free from striving. However, as I see it, music is superior to the other arts, as there is no object, per se of art. That is, while when we look at a painting, or at a sculpture, we see an individual thing, that is meant to show us the way to that which is contained in all individuals of the same kind, music has no perceivable object. It is &amp;quot;the way in which music is perceived, namely in and through time alone, with absolute exclusion of space&amp;quot; [266] that better clarifies this point. Just as the Platonic Ideas do not reside in space, per se, neither does music. That is, while objects representing the Platonic Ideas reside in space - such as trees - the Platonic Ideas do not reside in space, just as, while music can fill a space, music cannot be physically grabbed or moved. For these reasons, music and the Platonic Ideas, according to Schopenhauer, are both copies &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;of the will itself&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. [257]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is another aspect of the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism that needs to be brought up. Aesthetic contemplation is not something which can be kept up for long periods of time. That is, while we can indeed lose our self in the contemplation of some piece of art, or of some particular piece of music, there will always be some striving that will bring us back into our self. We can certainly contemplate Bach for an extended amount of time, but we will undoubtedly become hungry after a while. This is the will &amp;#39;pulling&amp;#39; us back into a self perspective, back into a subjective perspective, as a hungry human standing in some particular gallery listening to some particular music - the music of Bach - coming from some particular, brown and black, box in the wall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, asceticism strives towards a permanent separation from the self, or a permanent withdrawal from a subjective perspective. While aesthetic contemplation actively pursues the withdrawal, or tearing, from the will, asceticism pursues the destruction, or negation, of the will. This destruction occurs by denying the will of what it wills - striving does not cease, but fulfillment does. When the self realizes that it is a hungry human being, in need of food, it can either fulfill it&amp;#39;s desire for food, or it cannot. Only by doing the latter - by denying the will of it&amp;#39;s importance - can one work towards asceticism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yet, in both instances, aesthetic contemplation and asceticism, there still is a constant conflict of self-negation, however perhaps stronger in the latter case. That is, while in aesthetic contemplation suffering is of no matter and is forgotten, while as an ascetic, the suffering is still there, and not forgotten, but is of no matter - or, if of any concern, only as a reason for further asceticism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This, then, is the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism. Both require the denial of a self, of being a subject, and, in addition to that, the denial of the importance, or significance, of the will. While aesthetic contemplation arises above the will for a short time, asceticism attempts to deny the will for a much longer, even permanent, time. For this reason, one may argue that both are striving for the same thing, however, one seeks it more as a permanent solution, while the other seeks it temporarily. One also strives for it out of knowledge that all is suffering, and there is no individuation - asceticism - while the other strives for it because it is free from suffering - aesthetic contemplation.
