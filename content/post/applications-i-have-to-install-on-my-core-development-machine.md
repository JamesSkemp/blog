<p>Here's a listing of applications, as I run into them, that need to be installed on my core development machine.</p>
<ol>
<li>TortoiseSVN</li>
<li>iTunes</li>
<li>Oxygen Xml Editor</li>
<li>Visual Studio</li>
<li>CollabNet Subversion</li>
<li>FileZilla FTP client</li>
<li>Sun VirtualBox</li>
<li>Serious Samurize</li>
<li>7-Zip</li>
<li>Amazon MP3 Downloader</li>
</ol>
<p>Why bother creating this list? Because at the moment I've just upgraded to Windows 7 and need to reinstall my programs. Above is the order I did it.</p>
<h3>Notepad</h3>
<p>On every computer I touch for more than 15 minutes, I always add Notepad to the Send to menu. But where is it on Windows 7?</p>
<p>In Windows Explorer, type the following to immediately go to the SendTo folder:</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="powershell">shell:sendto</code></pre>
<p>That's easy.</p>
