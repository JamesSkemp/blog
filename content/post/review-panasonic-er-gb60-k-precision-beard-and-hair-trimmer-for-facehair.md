<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of the <a href="http://amzn.to/1O06RSk">Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer for Face/Hair</a>, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Spoiler: I really like them.</p></div>

<h3>Finally, something that works with my beard</h3>

<p>Right away I'll say that I haven't used these to clip the hair on the top of my head. I have some barbershop-quality clippers from Wahl that I use for that, and I've had no reason to try anything else.</p>

<p>However, for my beard I've tried a few clippers, the last of which were a lower-end set of Wahl clippers. They worked okay but they just didn't seem to clip as well as they should. Since I'm on a quest to find something that will work for my beard, when I saw these through the Amazon Vine program I knew I had to give them a go. And now, after trying the Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer, I have no reason to search any further.</p>

<p>The Panasonic ER-GB60-K is pretty simple, with only two set of clipper guards. However, these can be moved by the adjustable knob built into the body of the clippers to support a wide range of beard lengths. The maximum length is 20mm, so if you want something longer you'll have to look elsewhere. However, between the two guards you can get 1-20mm of length, so a great range.</p>

<p>What really does it for me is how well these clips. My professional Wahl clippers cut every time, while the lower end ones would end up tugging a bit on hairs (I blame the short blades). The blades on these clippers are on par with the professional Wahl ones, which means that you can expect hairs to be cut each time, no pulling.</p>

<p>I have no problem with holding the clippers, and the cut angle feels natural. This doesn't have any attachments, however, so if you want to trim any smaller areas these won't work. However, for the beard this won't be an issue, and you might use scissors to be a little more precise on a mustache.</p>

<p>The only thing that slightly worries me is the adjustable knob itself. I've never had it slip, but for some reason it just doesn't click as solidly as I'd like. Again, I haven't experienced any issues with it, but it's something I'll keep an eye on.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/1O06RSk">Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer</a> exceeded my expectations, and is absolutely worth a full 5 of 5 stars. If you have a beard in the 1-20mm range, definitely give this a look.</p>
