<div class="note">
<p>An updated version of this application was released. <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Music-Recommendations-Please!-version-05-beta.aspx">Download and find out more about version 0.5</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The one problem I have with music is when I try to find new music that I may like. Luckily there's a number of services that will provide recommendations, but these are typically only based on one artist, or across my entire library (in the case of the iTunes Genius service).</p>
<p>To make this a bit easier, I looked at <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Parsing-Lastfm-Web-Services-artistgetSimilar-with-C-and-LINQ-to-XML.aspx">Last.fm's Web services</a> as well as <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Parsing-Yahoo!-Musics-Artist-Web-Services-with-C-and-LINQ-to-XML-Search-for-artists.aspx">Yahoo! Music's Web services</a>. After some playing around, I've had a couple working versions of a simple application that allows for artists to be found, based upon either one or more artists.</p>
<p>Introducing Music Recommendations Please! This beta version will change significantly as I work towards version 1.0, but it's a nice proof of concept. In fact, this may end up being a Web application ... but I'd also like to be able to tie it into the&nbsp;output from <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">iTunes Playlists to Xml</a>, so who knows. I suppose it's easy enough to do both.</p>
<p>This application requires <strong>.NET Framework 3.5</strong> (<a rel="external" href="http://smallestdotnet.com/">check your version of the .NET Framework</a>), an active Internet connection, and that should be it. Extract the contents to a directory, or just open the executable from the zip file, to begin.</p>
<p><a rel="download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/MusicRecommendationsPlease_0.4.5.zip">Download Music Recommendations Please! version 0.4.5 beta</a>.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you have any suggestions on publically available APIs that I can use, please post them below.</p>
