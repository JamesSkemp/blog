<p>
After sleeping on it (albeit poorly), I&#39;ve resolved the issue that was stopping production on the new version of my <a href="/words/post/Cross-Sums-Number-Combinations-Guide.aspx">Cross Sums Helper</a> application. 
</p>
<p>
However, I need some help testing. 
</p>
<p>
Download <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/CrossSumsHelper_2.0.exe">Cross Sums Helper 2.0</a> - 67 KB (.NET Framework 2.0 or higher is required). 
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: Download <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/CrossSumsHelper_2.1.exe">Cross Sums Helper 2.1</a> - 65 KB 
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t have .NET Framework (and are on Windows) let me know - I had a hard time finding any real stats on these numbers, even from MS people. 
</p>
<p>
Initial testing done on: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Windows Vista Ultimate SP1</li>
	<li>Windows XP Home SP3</li>
</ul>
<p>
This program has moved from Visual Basic (6) to Visual C#, but still needs&nbsp;a couple of tweaks to be even leaner. 
</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Version 2.0: Initial 2.0 release,&nbsp;rewritten in C#, using .NET Framework 2.0. (2008.06.02 @ 7:30)</li>
	<li>Version 2.1: Code should be a bit leaner and faster,&nbsp;after some coding changes. (2008.06.02 @ 21:45)</li>
</ol>
