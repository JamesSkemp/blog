<p>
After a good deal of thought, I&#39;ve realized that philosophy in my life has decreased a good deal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had the time to think about philosophy as much as I&#39;d like.
</p>
<p>
For those reasons, I&#39;ll be focusing on both technology, as a site admin, as well as philosophy (as a philosopher).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll add the appropriate categorizations so that it will be semi-easy to switch between the two.

Looking back at this post, it&#39;s interesting that the philosophy just hasn&#39;t grown as much as I would have liked. There&#39;s 3 items &#39;tagged&#39; philosophy, and I think that they are all old articles that I&#39;ve reposted here. Now that I&#39;m in the technology field, as a profession, it&#39;s just easier to write about what I do, then what takes a good deal of thought to understand.
