[5 Boat House]
</p>
<p>
(A nice house, on the water.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;You&#39;re all alone here?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Koga got reacquainted with his dinner and went back with the corpse.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;What a wimp.&quot;
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
&quot;The scene, 22 minutes ago.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(A disk, which Togusa plugs into his neck.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;You made a rookie deal with this mess?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Life&#39;s a learning curve.&quot;
</p>
<!--adsense-->
<p>
(Electronically speaking.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got. Analysis of victim&#39;s brain yields ... Jack Volkerson, age 54. Consignment inspector for Locus Solus. He applied for leave five days ago and vanished. Three days ago, he rented this boathouse.
</p>
<p>
&quot;The murder weapon, kitchen utensils. Inspection of the area turned up a vehicle license linked to organized crime. We&#39;re checking it out.
</p>
<p>
&quot;Seven credit cards found in jacket, presumably the victim&#39;s. Investigating transaction history.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou is walking along a bookcase and spots one book that does not match the others.  He pulls it out - it&#39;s <em>The Doll</em> by Hans Bellmer - and opens it. He finds a photo of a girl.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;38 caliber SW Model 2602. Looks like he ran out of time.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Doubt it would&#39;ve done him much good.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;An illegally powerful cyborg,&#39; or maybe a professional faking a psycho.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;969 calling 906, 20 seconds away from the scene, don&#39;t touch.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Not a thing.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Let&#39;s leave this to Forensics.
</p>
<p>
&quot;907 calling 09. We&#39;re handing the scene over to 969.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;09, Roger.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Togusa: &quot;It&#39;s my daughter&#39;s birthday.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Family man, huh?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I&#39;ll drop you off.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Wrong direction. Ishikawa?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Not headed his way, either.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Okay. Daughter&#39;s birthday takes priority.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;You&#39;re a cheerful bunch.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The chief showing up at a scene?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The corpse is missing parts, that&#39;s why.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The place is all yours. Take your time.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;What&#39;s the big deal over a local case?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The boss has taken an interest.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Found it! Divided up in jars in the refrigerator. Heart, liver, kidneys, even the pancreas.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Conscientious bastard.&quot;
</p>
<p>
===
</p>
<p>
(An empty cage, with white feathers at the bottom.)
</p>
<p>
===
</p>
<p>
(Batou walks out of a store, carrying a bag.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Fresh dog food, huh? Stick to dry food and he&#39;ll last longer.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I can&#39;t feed him that.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;You&#39;re teamed up with Togusa? Beats being paired off with a rookie fresh out of training.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;For an ex-detective, he&#39;s got his uses. I&#39;ve got no complaints.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Except that the only one up to your standards was the Major.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Ishikawa starts to speak.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Cut the chatter, Ishikawa.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(They pull up to a curb, a display says that they are &#39;All clear&#39;.  Batou checks the rear-view and gets out.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Later.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Batou ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;What now?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Stick to the dry food. For nutritonal balance, it&#39;s better for the dog.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou walks away from the car, but as soon as it pulls away, he changes directions.  He walks through an alleyway, to a garage, pulls out a device which turns to 2501, then &quot;Safe&quot;, and heads towards a car.)
