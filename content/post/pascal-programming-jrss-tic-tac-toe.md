<p>JRSs Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe programmed with Dev-Pascal. It even keeps a tally of your points (win = +1, loss = -1).</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Current limitations:</h3>
<p>Runs in MS-DOS, and therefore lacks an interface of sorts</p>
<p>Again, lacks a pretty interface ;)<br />You can only play versus the computer.&nbsp; I would like to create a two player option at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Comments regarding this program are greatly appreciated. Thank you for using and testing my program.</p>
