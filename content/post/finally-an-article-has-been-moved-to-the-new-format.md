<p>
Long title today.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we&#39;ve got an article in the new format.  If you take a look at <a href="/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">http://strivinglife.net/articles/php/wakinglifescript.php</a>, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;ve moved my most popular page over to the new design.  I&#39;ve got an htaccess redirect in place, and have changed the internal links (I believe for the most part, but I haven&#39;t done a search yet).<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Whew.  Now I&#39;ve just got to move over the other pages as well.  However, I&#39;ll have an HTML version along with a PDF version of each new page.  Since the Waking Life script still needs a bit of work before I can release an HTML version, that means the other pages will be on hold as well.
</p>
<p>
In addition, I&#39;ll be removing the present Gallery and will be replacing it with another WordPress, specific for images.  This has been done by sites like the fantastic <a href="http://leoniegallery.blogspot.com/" title="Leonie Gallery">Leonie Gallery</a> [UPDATE 2007.07.21: Scroll down a bit to find links to her other galleries.], and I think that these kinds of sites have been able to pull it off (so I&#39;m going to try myself).  It&#39;s either that or I remove the Galleries entirely ...
</p>
<p>
Ah well.
</p>
