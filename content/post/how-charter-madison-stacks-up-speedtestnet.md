<p>
On CNET this morning I ran across Speedtest.net.&nbsp; Like sites and tools that have come before it, it&#39;s meant to test connection speeds between one computer and another.&nbsp; Unlike previous ones, however, the UI is much more attactive (i.e., more Web 2.0-like).

<p>
If you haven&#39;t tried it out yet, I recommend you do so.&nbsp; My results from Charter, in Madison WI, are below.

<p>
It&#39;ll be interesting to see just how long this stays up.&nbsp; It&#39;s been Dugg and /.&#39;d, and it&#39;s still giving fairly accurate numbers.&nbsp; But, can the site stay up with just AdSense?&nbsp; What are their costs?
