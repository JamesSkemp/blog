Yes, I&#39;m still alive, I&#39;m just not posting ...

Since Friday I&#39;ve been fighting a cold/flu, and the cold weather hasn&#39;t much helped. However, last Saturday morning I was feeling better, and along with lunch, picked up a camera I&#39;ll be writing about once this cold is dead.

Another camera? I&#39;ve still got my Canon 350D, but I haven&#39;t used it since it&#39;s gotten so cold. I decided that if I picked up a point-and-shoot camera I&#39;d probably take more pictures. For instance, there were at least two instances in December and January where I saw a great opportunity, but didn&#39;t have the time or desire to lug out my camera ...

My sister has a Nikon Coolpix S500, which she picked up in July-ish. Originally I was going to try to pick up one of those, since she likes it. However, since they didn&#39;t have any, it was either a lower model, or looking at cameras that had come out since then.

Ed at The Camera Company, on the west side of Madison (making this my first digital camera purchase not from the east side location of The Camera Company), showed me a Fujifilm camera, which felt way too light, and a Casio EX-Z1200. While it was more than I was expecting to spend, the Casio is a pretty solid camera, with a good deal of features. Since I&#39;ve been fighting this cold, I&#39;ve only taken&nbsp;fifty photos, and one video. Certainly not enough to be writing any reviews.
