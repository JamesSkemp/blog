<p>
... I&#39;m not an Ubuntu-only user yet (unlike some people I know).&nbsp; Granted, I like using it, since I&#39;ve believed, for some time, that if you want to run Apache, you can&#39;t really run it on Windows ...

<p>
(Granted, I&#39;m having a really difficult time trying to stick to my guns with Apache, versus IIS, but ... well, more on that in the future.)

I will probably blow this current box away and re-install Ubuntu, without the Windows partition, and doing a lot more building from source, for example, for Firefox. However, I&#39;m not ready to blow away my main box, and there&#39;s a big reason for that; Adobe.

Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Canon utilities for my Digital Rebel XT ... all reasons I need to keep my Windows box. Throw Internet Explorer 7.0 and Safari for Windows ... it&#39;s hard to justify really getting rid of my Windows system.

<p>
Upgrade the equipment on the machine I&#39;m using for Linux?&nbsp; Probably not. In fact, the next time I upgrade, it&#39;ll probably be to a Mac. Not that I&#39;m a die-hard Mac user, but Mac&#39;s just look cool, and I&#39;d really like to install Apache on a Mac ...
