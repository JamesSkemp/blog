<p>
I&#39;ve been quite ill since Sunday, hence no posts.  However, I&#39;m feeling better today, and not just because I got my copy of Studio 8.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Since I haven&#39;t been able to give a lot of thought about what I&#39;d like to write about today, I&#39;m going to err in giving too little, than too much.

So, I end this post here.
