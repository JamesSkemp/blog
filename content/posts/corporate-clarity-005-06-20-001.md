<p>
It&rsquo;s come to my attention that a number of team players have been taking full sixty minute lunch breaks in the past couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
As I&rsquo;m sure you all recall from our last outing in late April, most of our team players had been taking anywhere between thirty and fifty minute lunch breaks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite surprising, with these figures in mind, that our team players are now taking sixty minute breaks.&nbsp; I wonder why it is that this is now occurring.&nbsp; Can someone clarify for me why, not even two months later, we&rsquo;re seeing this change?
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m positive that there is a very good explanation for this behaviour, and I would really like to hear it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be scheduling a meeting for next Friday afternoon, around 3 o&rsquo;clock.
</p>
<p>
I noticed, while setting up the meeting, that a number of you had already made plans to be out.&nbsp; In fact, every single one of you, it appears, will have to cancel some other meetings or outings.&nbsp; I apologize for this, but I&rsquo;m sure you know how it is.
</p>
<p>
Please be prepared to give us your plan on bring us back to a comfortable lunch break schedule within the next couple of days.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we would all also like to hear how our individual team players&rsquo; times have changed over the past six months as well.
</p>
<p>
See you all on Friday.
