<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LD176IE?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Munchkin Panic</a>, provided for free as part of Amazon Vine.</p></div>

<h3>Enjoyable even for solo play</h3>

<p>Thus far I've only been able to play solo games of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LD176IE?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Munchkin Panic</a>, so this review will be based upon that fact.</p>

<p>I've never played Castle Panic, which this game is a variant of, but I'm familiar with Munchkin. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this game when I got it. Having played the one-player/solo variant of this game, I have to say I do enjoy it, and would be interested to see how it plays with more people.</p>

<p>The solo variant of the game has you remove less than a dozen cards from the game, as they in someway interact with other players (stealing treasures or the like). The rest of the rules are pretty much standard, and require you to defeat all of the enemies before all your towers fall. Once you've picked up the rules the game runs fairly quickly, although you should plan on at least an hour the first time.</p>

<p>Since the cards and monster order is random, the replay value is pretty high.</p>

<p>The art style is nice, and the game pieces are of a rather good quality.</p>

<p>I can honestly recommend this game, both for solo play, as well as versus and cooperative play (which would require removing only a few pieces). I give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LD176IE?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Munchkin Panic</a> 4 of 5 stars.</p>
