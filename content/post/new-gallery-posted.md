<p>
After a bit of looking around, for the best gallery application, I&#39;ve settled on SlideShowPro. While it does require Flash (version 7 or higher, but I&#39;m requiring version 8 or higher for mine), and it did cost some money, it&#39;s a great little application.<!--more-->

You can see what I&#39;ve currently got available at <a href="/gallery/">http://strivinglife.net/gallery/</a>.

There&#39;s still a lot I&#39;ve got to play with, but, it&#39;s at least got a start of 12 images (at this time). The gallery requires a pretty fast connection, but it is what it is.
