<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.crucial.com/" target="_blank">Crucial</a>&#39;s system scanner tool doesn&#39;t work on Linux. 
</p>
<p>
While unfortunate, it turns out that there&#39;s an easy way to determine how much memory you&#39;ve currently got, and how much you can increase that to, using a simple comand. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>sudo lshw</strong> 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s all there is to it. 
</p>
<p>
This gives not only an overview of how much you&#39;ve got, and how much you can have, but also what banks are in use with what, and other system-related &#39;stuff.&#39;

For better or worse, it looks like the Dell I got from work is maxed out. But, considering that it&#39;s running Ubuntu (which I haven&#39;t been on since September or October of last year) and it&#39;s running fine anyways ... 
</p>
<p>
(Of course, Crucial is pretty cool, in that you can find most standard computers on their site.)
