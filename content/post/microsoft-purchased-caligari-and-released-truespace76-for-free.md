<p>
I was big into 3d rendering in college, since I had a good deal of free time, and I wanted to do something productive.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, trueSpace, a fairly big name in 3D, is now available for free, thanks to Microsoft.&nbsp;It sounds like this was for Virtual Earth in particular, but Channel 9 (which is where I heard this release notice from) points out, correctly, that it&#39;s also very valuable for games (in particular, for Microsoft&#39;s XBox and game generation tools).

In addition to trueSpace7.6, the manual and video&nbsp;training is also available for download.&nbsp;
