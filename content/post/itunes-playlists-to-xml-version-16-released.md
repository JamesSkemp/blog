<p>Version 1.6 of iTunes Playlists to Xml is now available for download.</p>
<p>Download <a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_1.6.zip">iTunes Playlists to Xml 1.6</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing and more information</h3>
<p>If you're new to iTunes Playlists to Xml, I've created a 'product page' for <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">iTunes Playlists to Xml</a> with all the information needed to get started.</p>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>any version of 1.4 or 1.5</strong>&nbsp;you need to replace the following files with those in the above archive:</p>
<ul>
<li>AlbumName.xslt</li>
<li>iTunesPlaylists2Xml.xslt</li>
<li>iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe</li>
<li>NameArtistAlbumPlay.xslt</li>
</ul>
<p>Your configuration file&nbsp;should be upgraded with the new functionality automatically.</p>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>version 1.3 or earlier</strong>, extract the contents of the zip replacing everything <em>but</em> the iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe.config file; when you start the application after upgrading the configuration file <em>should</em> be automatically upgraded with all new settings. If you get a configuration error, then replace this file with the new version. Remember to update your name in the Settings menu.</p>
<h3>Changes from version 1.5.3</h3>
<p>With the release of .NET Framework 4 a few weeks ago, I figure it's safe to move from .NET Framework 2.0 to 3.5 in iTunes Playlists to Xml. Therefore, <a rel="external" href="http://smallestdotnet.com/"><strong>.NET Framework</strong></a><strong> 3.5&nbsp;is now required</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to the new requirement, version 1.6 of iTunes Playlists to Xml adds the ability to save playlists to HTML, in addition to XML.</p>
<h3>Features for&nbsp;future releases</h3>
<p>A future release will allow you to change the elements that are output by default via the user interface (it's possible now via the <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml.htm#advanced">command line</a>).</p>
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>As always, comments and suggestions are appreciated.</p>
