<p>Really? You're a policeman?! Are you one of the higher ups, by any chance?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>All right. My fee is that you request me whenever you come here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. Can you guess what it was?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You're looking for an eligible man? +1</p>
<p>I could never do that. You should really try to apply yourself to your work or you'll never be anything but a loser.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Ouch... +1</p>
<p>Do you have any plans for your future?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I'd like to walk a beat in a small town. +1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing me (email)</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>"You're a really interesting girl." +.25</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You didn't think I was writing to you personally, did you?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You shouldn't play that kind of trick on a cop. +1</p>
<p>Do you think you measure up in that department?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I've always been good at solving puzzles. +1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8+ hearts - what do you first notice? &gt; Hands +.5</p>
<p>Think of it as a chance to talk and drink with girls. Otherwise, you're probably just wasting your money.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>No, I'm going to find a girlfriend this way. +1</p>
<p>Customers like that are more common than you might think. I don't care how much they pay, I can't stand them.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So what kind of things are okay to talk about? +? (at least .25)</p>
<p>Yep! How much money do you have saved?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A good amount. +?</p>
<p>What kind of things do you like to talk about?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I'm interested in social issues. +?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This... (email)</p>

<p>(date)</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Watami &gt; Iron Skillet Potstickers +0</p>
<p>===10 to 15 hearts</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You can be happy without money, you know. +1</p>
<p>I've been thinking about chaning my hairstyle. What do you think?</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sounds like a good idea to me.</p>
<p>No that's no the case. He would never do that to me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>You almost sound like his mother. +1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14+ hearts - What do you think I should learn? &gt; Mouth +? (at least .75)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be inspired by the latest trends in Kamurocho hostess clubs and make them available nationwide. I think it could be really popular.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sounds like a good idea. +?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>High price to pay (email)</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>"I hate it when people cancel on me suddenly." +.5</p>
<p>(date)</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Watami &gt; Sashimi Platter +?</p>
<p>===15 to 20 hearts</p>
<p>Something interesting, eh? Well...</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>777 Town. +.5</p>
<p>Yes... Apparently my brother was so intent on making money for the club that he forced some customers to order things they couldn't afford.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Sounds familiar. +1</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been thinking about quitting my job at the cosmetics company so I can focus on my business.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What about your job at the club? +1</p>
<p>But you wouldn't be my customer anymore. It would be a little strange.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Maybe it's our chance for love. +1</p>
<p>Stressed out (email)</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>"Champagne is asking a little too much..."</p>
