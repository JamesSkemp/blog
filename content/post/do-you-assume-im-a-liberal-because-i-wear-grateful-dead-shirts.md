<p>
I ran into a co-worker who suggested that&nbsp;I probably held a certain environmental view,&nbsp;because I was wearing a Grateful Dead shirt. 
</p>
<p>
While I knew it to be true, I&#39;d never really thought that my political views too may be out there based upon the band t-shirt that I was wearing. 
</p>
<p>
Wearing Grateful Dead? Liberal. 
</p>
<p>
Wearing Bruce Springsteen? Liberal. 
</p>
<p>
Wearing Fleetwood Mac? Liberal. 
</p>
<p>
Billy Joel? That&#39;s probably liberal as well. 
</p>
<p>
My co-worker Rob (looks like his domain expired)&nbsp;was wearing a OS X shirt. Liberal? Conservative? I know it&#39;s the former, but it raised the question (in my mind), would a conservative ever wear that shirt? Would they ever wear one of my shirts? 
</p>
<p>
Do I like the Grateful Dead because I&#39;m a liberal, or am I a liberal because I like the Grateful Dead? How about technology? 
</p>
<p>
Hmm ...
