<div class="note">
<p>This is a review of <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7GUK?tag=strivinglifen-20">AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>I purchased this for an additional (and longer) cable for a Playstation 3 controller. It works perfectly (although I realize now I would have preferred a few feet longer - oh well).</p>
<p>The fact that it comes in Amazon's hassle free packaging is another definite plus, although since the box was rather large, when I received my package in the mail, I thought perhaps it was the Blu-ray movies I'd purchased shaking about.</p>
<p>This is my first AmazonBasics product purchase, but it will definitely not be my last.</p>
