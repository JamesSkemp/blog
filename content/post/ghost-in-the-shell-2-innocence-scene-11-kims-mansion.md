[11 Kim&#39;s Mansion]
</p>
<p>
&quot;He used to be a long-range military scout. &#39;Unfit as a commander, unfit to be commanded, fit only to languish by the wayside.&#39; He bounced around between Special Forces and Electronics, and got into black market weapons. His reputation turned to shit. Wound up your garden-variety hacker.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Sounds like quite a story.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yeah, but no matter how far a jackass travels, it won&#39;t come back a horse. His downfall came when his reach exceeded his grasp. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

(&#39;aemaeth&#39; is written on the ground, with a girl pointing down to them.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Batou, the study on the top floor.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(There&#39;s a body laying back in a chair, the back of the head severly charred.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;I guess we were a little late. Pro-active firewalls must have zapped him hacking in somewhere. In any case, doesn&#39;t look like he would&#39;ve been of much use.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;The deceased firmly declines offerings of fresh or artificial flowers or birds released in his honor.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou throws the chair onto it&#39;s side, knocking the body onto the floor.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Hey!&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;Sleep not you of the dead.&#39; Even Confucius says you should never pretend to sleep like a corpse. I haven&#39;t got time for your stupid little jokes, Kim.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(The body begins to laugh.)
</p>
<p>
===
</p>
<p>
&quot;Haven&#39;t seen you since that landing operation in Nemuro.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I&#39;m here on a job.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Meaning Locus Solus? They came late to the robot racket, but expanded rapidly once they focused on high-end gynoids. There are whispers of links to politicians, bureaucrats, even crime syndicates. Wary of local regulators for these &#39;specialized&#39; mannequins, they shifted all production to a multi-national factory ship anchored in international waters. They turn out some mighty fine dolls.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Fine enough to commit suicide after murdering humans?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;If that&#39;s true, it&#39;s pretty unseemly. That would mean replicating humans by breathing souls into dolls. Who&#39;d want to do that? The definition of a truly beautiful doll is a living, breathing body devoid of a soul. &#39;An unyielding corpse, tiptoeing on the brink of collapse.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Or reduced to a ravaged body with an e-brain... like you.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The human is no match for a doll, in its form, its elegance in motion, its very being. The inadequacies of human awareness become the inadequacies of life&#39;s reality. Perfection is possible only for those without consciousness, or perhaps endowed with infinite consciousness. In other words, for dolls and for gods.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we get back to business?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Actually there&#39;s one more mode of existence commensurate with dolls and deities.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Animals?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Shelley&#39;s skylarks are suffused with a profound, instinctive joy. Joy we humans, driven by self-consciousness, can never know. For those of us who lust after knowledge, it is a condition more elusive than godhood.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;And this conundrum compelled you to inhabit a doll and play dead? Is that your reason?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;Without knowing life, how can we know death?&#39; That&#39;s what Confucius says.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Togusa pulls two books away from the bookshelf, and a model of the house comes out from the wall.  He looks into a hole, and we see the scene from the beginning of this scene from above.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;It is a rare human how knows death. Most meet death unprepared, armed only with ignorant familiarity. In other words, people die simply because it is inevitable.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;But death is a precondition of life for a doll.&quot;
</p>
