<p>Somehow, while I wasn't looking, the Log Parser Plus Web site has grown to what I consider a nice size over the last handful of months.</p>
<p>As the <a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/">Log Parser Plus Web site</a> moves towards 2000 visits a month I'll be making a number of changes in an attempt to make it even more useful.</p>
<p>Some changes I've already made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/New-Log-Parser-Plus-Web-site-design.aspx">a new design</a>.</li>
<li>Added login functionality.</li>
<li>Added ELMAH support. (Administrative)</li>
</ol>
<p>My current plan with item number 2 is to potentially tie in OpenID functionality so that individuals can easily submit their own examples.</p>
<p>Additional changes planned for the coming weeks/months:</p>
<ol>
<li>Migrate from XML sources to SQL. (Administrative)</li>
<li>Add information about XML parsing.</li>
<li>Add information about parsing text documents.</li>
<li>Add information about running SQL from a file instead of via the command line (my preferred way to run queries).</li>
<li>Add functionality for users to comment on individual examples. (May not happen, since I'm not sure about demand.)</li>
<li>Add functionality to export queries to files, which goes along with item 4.</li>
<li>Review of the Log Parser book. (Having only skimmed it, this would be after I sat down and read it.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Have an idea about something else? I've just added a page to collect <a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/Home/Feedback">feedback on Log Parser Plus</a>.</p>
