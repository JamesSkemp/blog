<p>
I&#39;ve added four new photos to the Capitol - Madison WI gallery at <a href="http://strivinglife.com/gallery/">http://strivinglife.net/gallery/</a>.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
These four pictures were taken last night off of John Nolen Drive. They still need some cleanup before I even think about printing them off, but, it&#39;s a start.
</p>
<p>
Best of all, the perspective includes the &#39;magic spot&#39;, where I&#39;ve been wanting to take a picture from for a very long time ...
