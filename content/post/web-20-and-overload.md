<p>
I&#39;ve been reading a good deal today, before and after my excursion around Madison (on Homecoming game-day, even).  There are three that really stick out:<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
First, we have <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html</a>, which is an article by Tim O&#39;Reilly on Web 2.0.  If you&#39;ve heard of it, or if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s worth a read.  Since I&#39;ve only skimmed the first two pages, I&#39;m not sure about lasting worth, but ...

</p>
<p>
Which leads into <a href="http://www.rootburn.com/2004/12/too-much-of-good-thing.html">http://www.rootburn.com/2004/12/too-much-of-good-thing.html</a>, on too much of a good thing.  Specifically photos, but I think it&#39;s applicable to the whole Web 2.0 &#39;movement&#39;, thereby bringing us back to link one.
