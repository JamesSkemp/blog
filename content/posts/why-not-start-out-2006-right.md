<p>
With the new year, comes a couple of smart technology reminders.  Your computer can&#39;t stay clean by itself - make sure you&#39;re doing your part.  And with the new year, and new month, why not verify things are up-to-date now?<!--more--><!--adsense-->

1. Make sure you&#39;re running the most up-to-date product, with the most up-to-date definitions for your anti-virus software.  Not using a AV program?  Grisoft offers AVG for free for home users.  I&#39;ve used this product for years and stand behind it 100%. http://www.grisoft.com/doc/289/lng/us/tpl/tpl01
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re using Norton Internet Security, on the other hand, don&#39;t update to NIS 2006 - either update your past version&#39;s definitions, or look for another product.

2. Ad-Aware - it just makes sense.  Download Ad-Aware and run it on a semi-regular basis.  Your computer, mouse, keyboard, and network will thank you.  Again, completely free.  http://www.lavasoft.de/software/adaware/

3. Disk Defragmentation.  If you&#39;re running a new version of Windows (like XP), there&#39;s no reason not to defragment on a semi-regular basis.  Heck, it&#39;s already installed.  Under the Start menu&#39;s programs, Accessories &gt; System Tools.
