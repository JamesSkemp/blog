Hello. 
</p>
<p>
FYI, I&#39;m using IE 7, and it can be somewhat difficult to update my queue. Specifically, to change the format of the movie I would like to receive. When I attempt to change the format, I will either trigger the move &#39;action&#39; instead of the drop-down, while other times I can trigger the drop-down, but can&#39;t select/change to Blu-ray format. 
</p>
<p>
This also happens when I try to click on a title to view more details, or perhaps play instantly. Rather bothersome. 
</p>
<p>
Along these same lines, perhaps we could have the ability to update all our movies at once (specifically, the format)? 
</p>
<p>
How about being able to move a movie to the bottom of our list (not just the top)? 
</p>
