<p>
... so save yourself some time and checkout this <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_3_map" target="_blank">very handy map of the Fallout 3 world</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the map isn&#39;t required, by any means, but it was actually a really big help on getting to 100% understanding of the in-game &#39;compass.&#39;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The rest of the wiki is also packed with information, even though, unlike a true wiki, members don&#39;t seem to be able to edit items. (I noticed&nbsp;a minor style&nbsp;mistake that I could fix if I could edit an entry, but since I can&#39;t&nbsp;edit it, and can&#39;t find contact information ...)

<p>
Tagged Xbox 360 since I don&#39;t really care about Playstation&#39;s trophies, so that&#39;s what system I picked Fallout 3 up for.
