After having seen a blog that did it, I&#39;ve installed a nifty little WordPress plugin that displays word count, image count, and estimated reading time. For some of my articles, the estimated reading time is going to be far off, but ... it&#39;s nifty nonetheless.&nbsp; Reminder - I&#39;ll be posting the &#39;second part&#39; of the MySQL tutorial tonight.
