        <p>
I&#39;ve wanted to watch the debate for some time, so, after the one on Friday, I decided it was time to take a look for some video.  I did find a copy of the first one, from WisPolitics.com, so here&#39;s my comments on the debate.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: Thanks to <a href="http://framingbusiness.net/">Gavin</a>, I know Green is a jerk.  If you live in Wisconsin, and you watch TV, you&#39;ve probably also seen Green&#39;s ads, where he likes to attack Doyle, even though Doyle is running pretty nice ads.  So, full disclosure, I&#39;ll be voting for Doyle this year, and I hope my fellow Wisconsin citizens will as well.
</p>
<p>
The video of this debate can be found at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=71609">http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=71609</a>, unless they&#39;ve pulled it down.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
On the first question, it was asked how specifically they would reduce spending (and thereby reduce taxes).  Doyle discussed what he&#39;s discussed in his ads, talking about how he&#39;s sold state property, and cut some state jobs.  Green, on the other hand, talked about how taxes are more than just numbers, equating it instead to freedom.  Yet, while his conversation was a true one, he did little to answer the question in his minute and a half, even though he alluded to them when he said that Doyle hadn&#39;t made the &quot;hard choices&quot;.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Doyle alluded to Washington&#39;s spending policies (which are equal to &#39;spend spend spend&#39; - my words, not his), while Green stated that spending has not been cut, suggesting instead that&#39;s increased, and that Wisconsin is still in a deficit.
</p>
<p>
On the second question, it was asked how the budget gap would be decreased without raising taxes, or while legislating new programs.  Green would tighten spending by looking at the IT contracts, of which he mentions two.  Waste in programs is the second thing that he&#39;d look at it, for example, economic development.  Doyle again mentioned what he&#39;s done, as well as that one of the contracts Green mentioned was already signed when Doyle had come into office.  Doyle will continue to look at ways to merge offices, and cut spending.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Green said that Doyle has raided various funds in order to bring spending down, at least on paper.  Doyle didn&#39;t respond to this particular item, but he did say that if he needed to increase one area, in order to preserve another, he would do so (increase transportation taxes in order to save schools).
</p>
<p>
The third question was what specific incentives they would provide in order to keep educated young people in, and bring better jobs into, the state.  Doyle gave biotech and stem-cell research two areas that he&#39;d like to increase in Wisconsin, as well as manufacturing jobs.  He gave numbers that 80%+ of college and tech students stay in the state, but that we have a ways to go.  Green, on the other hand, states that jobs have not increased in Wisconsin.  He also stated that he doesn&#39;t want his kids to leave, and that leaving is not about the numbers (see also question one), but about what else is lost - dreams, visions, and our future.  Staying in Wisconsin means earning less, and paying more, such as in property taxes.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Doyle refers to Green&#39;s time in the Wisconsin legislature, and how taxes were higher.  He did veto property tax freezes, because they would have cut education spending.  Green stated that there isn&#39;t an abudance of good jobs, and referred specifically to Milwaukee.
</p>
<p>
The moderator asked if the question had been answered, but the questioner was looking for some specifics.  Doyle gave a couple examples of what he&#39;s done to help foster new businesses.  Green would lower the tax burden.
</p>
<p>
The fourth question was regarding the five taxes of income, property, sales, corporate, and excised taxes and fees.  Which are the most fair, and which are the least fair.  Again, Green says that taxes aren&#39;t about the numbers, but are about much more (like planning for the future).  According to Green, all of the taxes are too high, and we need to cut government spending.  Doyle talked about some specific personal spending that he&#39;d like to decrease taxes on (such as social security and health care) for middle class familes, and also refers to Washington&#39;s tax decreases for oil companies.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t really answer the question, but perhaps suggests income taxes should be, or are, decreased.
</p>
<p>
The follow-up question is how would you reorder these, or what are the most important.  Doyle says that property taxes are, and that these have already slowed down.  Green answers Doyle by stating that property taxes have increased, and that taxes are still too high.  He then asks if anyone thinks that their taxes are just fine (they are being taxed the right amount) or too low, then Green is not their candidate.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Doyle discusses the property tax freeze, and states that there was no provisions for education.  Doyle states, again, that education is very important to me, and that he&#39;ll continue to preserve that.  Green states, again, that taxes are too high, and that&#39;s hurting business.  A freeze would not cut spending, but keep it from rising.
</p>
<p>
The fifth question was regarding the economy, specifically in Milwaukee (County), where a number of plants have closed.  Doyle stated he&#39;d like to bring in high-tech companies, and give special incentives to companies that would move into communities with high unemployment rates.  Green states that taxes, liability costs, and regulatory costs are keeping new businesses away.  He states that we don&#39;t have a people problem, since Wisconsin workers are hard working and honest, but rather a leadership problem, which refuses to break down the barriers keeping new business out.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Doyle states that Green is wrong about the growth, and that Wisconsin technical colleges and businesses have a relationship to determine what kinds of jobs/training is required.  Green had a short response, listing a number of tax increases that Doyle wanted to bring about.
</p>
<p>
The next question was regarding the shift from manufacturing jobs to IT-related jobs, and Internet-based businesses.  Green stated that Doyle wants to continue the tax on Internet access.  He wants to continue to invest in education, but work harder on hooking up businesses with people who can supply the needed, trained, workforce.  BadgerNet, according to Doyle, has helped doubled the number of areas with access to high-speed Internet, and he hopes that the state will have 100% access soon.  Technical colleges, which may have seen some spending cuts, is where we should focus in order to increase skilled workers in the IT field.
</p>
<p>
In the open debate, Green states that tuition for in-state individuals has continued to increase, and that property tax, for home-based Internet businesses, is a major cost.  Doyle states that he&#39;s increased financial aid for students, but that loan access has been cut in Congress.
</p>
<p>
The seventh question was regarding freezing property taxes, and local government.  If property taxes are freezed, how can local governments be helped in order to provide support.  Doyle states that freezes should occur only after the state has provided what it needs to to local government - only after it has fulfilled it&#39;s responsibility.  Green states that mandates should be cut, and that we need to stop raiding funds.  In the open debate, Doyle states that if he needs to raid funds in order to preserve some things, like education, he&#39;s going to do so.  Green states that funds we didn&#39;t need should have gone back to the people of Wisconsin, and that raiding from transportation fund means that more of our money goes towards paying off bonds, then on new construction.
</p>
<p>
The eighth, and final question, was how they would propose to keep retirees in the state.  Green states that losing retirees is more about the numbers, but also about the lose of venture capital.  Property taxes, among other taxes, is what is chasing away seniors.  Doyle states that he doesn&#39;t believe taxes are okay, and that we&#39;ve eliminated the tax on social security in Wisconsin.  The estate/death tax will be ended by next year as well.  Cuts cannot be done without thinking about the consequences, specifically regarding education.  Grandparents want their grandchildren to go to good schools, and freezing taxes as Mark Green would suggest, would mean that education spending would need to be cut.
</p>
<p>
There was no open debate regarding this question.  On with the closing statement.  Green won the toss, but elected to go last.
</p>
<p>
Doyle states that advanced manufacturing is what Wisconsin is looking for.  Green states that Wisconsin has what it needs to meet the challenges - it has it&#39;s people.  However, it needs leadership which sets people free.
