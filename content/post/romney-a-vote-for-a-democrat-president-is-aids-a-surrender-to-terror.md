<p>
Special edition over my lunch break ... 
</p>
<p>
It seems Mitt Romney, former presidential hopeful, has withdrawn from the race. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections08/mittromney/story/0,,2254242,00.html" target="_blank">Guardian Unlimited</a> quotes him as such: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;In this time of war I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror,&quot; he told the Conservative Political Action Committee 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As with the 2004 race, once again a Republican is stating that a Democrat president would result in the United States surrendering to terror (sadly, it doesn&#39;t look like that piece was moved over to the site, but I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t dig it up and re-post it tonight). 
</p>
<p>
I suppose the lesson learned by a NY-hopeful hasn&#39;t fully reached the entire party yet (although said NY hopeful was pretty delusion to think 9/11 and campaigning in a couple of states would honestly win him much in the way of votes).&nbsp;
