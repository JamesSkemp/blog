<p>
Today I purchased a new television, to replace my tried-and-true Philips 20&quot;. After a couple of months of research, and etcetera, I decided to go with a Sony Bravia. 
</p>
<p>
Since my previous television was a 20&quot;, purchased back during my sophmore or junior year of college, and still using &#39;tube&#39; technology, I figured it was time to upgrade, especially since I&#39;ve been watching more movies via Netflix, and am planning on purchasing one of the current next-gen video game systems (P3 or 360). 
</p>
<p>
For me, there was no question between plasma, projection, and LCD. I also definitely had to have widescreen (not that you can&#39;t get much of anything else with LCD). 
</p>
<p>
I had to choose between the 26&quot; and the 32&quot;, and because the price difference was only $100 - $700 versus $800, at least at Best Buy this week&nbsp;- I went with the 32&quot; (the KDL-32M3000). 
</p>
<p>
I purchased an RCA antenna back in 2005, when I was living downtown, and have been using it with my televisions since. After plugging it into my new tv, I was able to get both standard analog channels, as well as a number of digital channels. 
</p>
<p>
However, I did have to spend some time messing with the antenna to get both Fox 47 and NBC 15 at the &#39;same&#39; time (id est, with the same settings). 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll post more about this television as I use it, but I&#39;m pretty happy after a couple of hours of use. My first movie on the television? Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s. My first full show? That 70s Show, interestingly enough (not much else on at 5 on a Saturday afternoon).
