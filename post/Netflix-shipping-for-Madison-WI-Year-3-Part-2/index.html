<h3>Plan changes</h3>
<p>There have been no changes at this time.</p>
<h3>The times</h3>
<p><strong>03/27/2009</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. (Henceforth, MRNOS.)<br /><strong>03/28/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Quantum of Solace (2008), which actually means I probably was the second person to have this disc. I'll drop it off tomorrow or Monday, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. That's a lot of Milwaukee mailers in a row.<br /><strong>03/31/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/01/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched most of the first episode of Firefly: The Complete Series: Disc 1 (2002).<br /><strong>04/02/2009</strong> (R) - Watched the rest of episode 1, and all of episodes 2 and 3, of Firefly: The Complete Series: Disc 1 (2002). I'll use a Milwaukee (3079) mailer instead of the Madison mailer I received it in, when I drop it off tomorrow.<br /><strong>04/06/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/07/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched all four episodes on Firefly: Disc 2 (2002), which I'll drop off in the mail tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. This is the disc that started me really getting into this series.<br /><strong>04/09/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/10/2009</strong> (F)&nbsp;- Received and watched all four episodes of Firefly: Disc 3 (2002). I'll keep the Madison mailer I received it in, and use a Milwaukee (3079) mailer instead. I'll let the postal employee pick it up today.<br /><strong>04/11/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched Eraserhead (1977) on my Xbox. Huh? Falling asleep during the movie = 2 stars.<br /><strong>04/13/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/14/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Firefly: Disc 4 (2002). I'll drop it off tomorrow. This is probably a 'buy' series.<br /><strong>04/16/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Watched Super High Me (2007) on my Xbox. It was okay; the end with the DEA was depressing.<br /><strong>04/17/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Spirit (2008), which I'll drop off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee mailer (3079) I received it in. It was okay, but the story was all over the place. (I let the mail person pick it up Saturday morning.)<br /><strong>04/20/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/21/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Fargo (1996), which I'll drop off tomorrow. I'm glad I watched this after I had watched their other films (that I've seen).<br /><strong>04/23/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/24/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). It was on the high end of okay. I'll drop it off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. (Forgot, and didn't mail it off until Monday.)<br /><strong>04/28/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/29/2009</strong> (W) - Received next movie.<br /><strong>04/30/2009</strong> (R) - Watched Death Note (2006). Long, but pretty good. Good guy becomes another bad guy. But who's worse? Guess that means I should watch the anime on Adult Swim, eh? Dropped it off in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in, tonight (which means tomorrow pickup).<br /><strong>05/01/2009</strong> (F) - Watched Serenity (2005) on the Xbox. Magnificent. Watched Heavy Metal (1981) again on the Xbox. It's a solid 3 star movie, with a cool opening clip, and insight into the Blue Oyster Cult album, but a solid 3 stars.<br /><strong>05/04/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/05/2009</strong> (T)&nbsp;- Received and watched Death Note II: The Last Name (2006). It didn't end how I expected, but I really liked it. 4.5 stars, but unable to do that, I gave it four. Really rather good. Mailing using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer that I received it in.<br /><strong>05/07/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/08/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Sting (1973), which was still good, even though I knew how it was going to end. I'll drop it off tomorrow, using Madison mailer.<br /><strong>05/11/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/12/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Trafic (1971). Slow, but laugh-out-loud moments; the accident, of course, and when he pulled down the ivy come to mind. I'm ignoring the Milwaukee mailer I received it in, and putting it in a spare Madison one.<br /><strong>05/14/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/15/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not (2002). Shown from both sides, this one was slow, but extremely good. I'll drop it off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/18/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/19/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Machine Girl (2008). The cast was enjoyable, but the effects and etcetera per pretty awful. I'll drop it off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/21/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/22/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Friday the 13th (1980). I gave it three stars, only because it's tame by today's standards. However, the end was pretty nice. (Not the end-end, but the near-end.) I'll drop it off or let it be picked up tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/24/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007) online. Should have watched it earlier. Watched WALL-E (2008) online. Another that I should have watched earlier.<br /><strong>05/25/2009</strong> (M) - Watched Foxy Brown (1974) online.<br /><strong>05/26/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/27/2009</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but I was out of town until Friday, so ...<br /><strong>05/29/2009</strong> (F) - Watched Belle de Jour (1967). Eh. I'll drop it off tomorrow (finally got a Madison mailer too).<br /><strong>05/31/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film (2006) online. It seemed to jump around a bit, but it was pretty darn good.<br /><strong>06/01/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/02/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1983). An honestly great movie. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br /><strong>06/04/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/05/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Day of the Dead (1985). Sara(h) sure looks familar ... Anywho, first zombie movie where one has used a gun, with such skill. I'll drop it off or let it be picked up tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/06/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched Mimic (1997) online. Wow.<br /><strong>06/07/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Pan's Labyrinth (2006) online. Watched King Corn (2007) online. Watched episodes 1 and 2 of Red Dwarf: Season 1 (1988) online. Eh.<br /><strong>06/08/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/09/2009</strong> (T) - Received next movie. Watched Iron Man (2008) again with my sister.<br /><strong>06/10/2009</strong> (W) - Watched 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007) in the morning. Beautiful movie, but the singing in the last part was jarring. I'll drop it off on my way to work, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/11/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/12/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Halloween (1978). I thought I had watched it before, but it seemed new to me ... I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/13/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched all six episodes of The IT Crowd: Season 1&nbsp;(2006) online.<br /><strong>06/15/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched Let the Right One In (2008) online. The <em>best</em> film I've seen in a while. Wow. Wow. Wow.<br /><strong>06/16/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), which I'll drop off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/18/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/19/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Mulholland Drive (2001). Yowsa. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>06/20/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched Up (2009) in the theatres with my sister. The villian is more classic Disney-like then Wall-E's, and wasn't too shabby of a movie.<br /><strong>06/22/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched The Wrestler (2008), courtesy of one of my sister's friends. Very good movie. The first 45 minutes seem slow, but the last hour just flys by.<br /><strong>06/23/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Branded to Kill (1967) which was just too disjointed for me. I'll drop off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079)&nbsp;mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/25/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/26/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched 28 Weeks Later (2007). Should have killed the mother/kid. Sorry. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>06/29/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/30/2009</strong> (T) - Watched Liam Neeson takes Paris, also known as Taken (2008). Very good. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>07/02/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/03/2009</strong> (F) - Should have received next movie, but since I wasn't around ...<br /><strong>07/04/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched From Hell (2001), which I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday morning, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Child's Play 2: Chucky's Back (1990), which was surprisingly memorable (I could remember much of it) and good.<br /><strong>07/06/2009</strong> (M) - Watched all six episodes of The IT Crowd: Season 2 (2007) online. Episode 1 = so funny I was crying. The rest were good, but it seemed to get lost as the season ended.<br /><strong>07/07/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/08/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975). Eh. Okay, but not the best film I've seen.&nbsp;I'll drop off tomorrow, using the Madison mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/10/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/11/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Screamers (1996). Actually, outside of the 'eh' CG effects, it's not that bad, and it's definitely better than Imposter. I'll drop it off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/14/2009</strong> (T)&nbsp;- MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/15/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Do the Right Thing (1989). Great cast, and great climax, but the ending left me confused. Lee's character knew it was wrong, but did it. And him and Aiello seem okay afterwards (Aiello knew he had to do it). I'll drop it off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/17/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/18/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Great Race (1965). I thought I had seen it before based on the beginning, but as the movie progressed, I realized I was wrong (or had only seen some of the very beginning). I'll drop it off Sunday or Monday morning, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/21/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/22/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Demetri Martin. Person. (2007) which wasn't near as good as I hoped. I'll drop off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/24/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/25/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Machinist (2007). Messed up, but very good. Like Memento, I guess, of a sorts. Will drop off tomorrow using the Madison mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/28/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/29/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Coraline (2008). Five-star. Animation is better than Nightmare Before Christmas (although I have watched that a number of times, and this was the first I saw this). Perfect. I'll drop off tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/31/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/01/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br /><strong>08/02/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Battle Royale (2001), which I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/03/2009</strong> (M) - Watched Tokyo Zombie (2005) online, which wasn't very good, and was dubbed.<br /><strong>08/04/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/05/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/07/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/08/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Suicide Club (2002). I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday morning.<br /><strong>08/11/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/12/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Suspect Zero (2004) with my sister. Will drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/14/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/15/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched episodes 1-4 of Little Britain: Series 1 (2003). Dan Conderman made it seem a lot funnier. Received and watched The Fast and the Furious (2001). Actually, honestly, really good. I'll drop off tomorrow, on my way up north.<br /><strong>08/18/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/19/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Ichi the Killer: Special Edition (2001). What a messed up movie. I'll drop it off tomorrow, using a Madison mailer, and not the Milwaukee mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/22/2009</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. No idea why it took so long for them to receive this.<br /><strong>08/24/2009</strong> (M) - Received and watched American Psycho: Uncut Version (2000), which I unfortunately found boring. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/26/2009</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/27/2009</strong> (R) - Received and watched He Was a Quiet Man (2007). I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/29/2009</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/31/2009</strong> (M) - Received and watched Ghost of Mae Nak (2005). Actually pretty good. Ended about how I thought it would, although I was kind of expecting just a Ring knock-off (ending still left you semi-guessing). I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/02/2009</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/03/2009</strong> (R) - Received and watched Vampires (1998), which I haven't watched in a while. Pretty good. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in, since I'm off tomorrow, and don't feel like driving.<br /><strong>09/05/2009</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Monday is a holiday, so I should get it Tuesday.<br /><strong>09/07/2009</strong> (M) - Watched Spy Hard (1996) online. Not too bad; funnier than I was expecting. Re-watched Episode 1 of The IT Crowd: Season 2 (2007), this time without disruptions.<br /><strong>09/08/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Chronicles of Riddick: Unrated Director's Cut (2004), which was like Dune (in that they seemed to make it too complex of a story) but was rather good (and I was able to finish it, unlike Dune). I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/09/2009</strong> (W) - Went home sick, so to kill some time, watched Welcome to Macintosh (2008) online. Wasn't that good only because it didn't go to the detail I would have liked. Jumped around&nbsp;a lot as well. Watched Dead Leaves (2004) online, which I thought might be okay, but it was almost completely a waste of time. Re-watched Parasite Dolls (2004) online.<br /><strong>09/10/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/11/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), which was rather good, IMO. Will need to find out if they had another after this (I seem to think that they did). Will let it be picked up tomorrow, or will otherwise drop it off (tomorrow), using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/14/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/15/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2008), the same day it released. Nice. Anywho, good movie. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/17/2009</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix, but the second one on my&nbsp;list was sent.<br /><strong>09/18/2009</strong> (F) - Netflix shipped another movie out, since it wasn't available right away, meaning that I'll get one today and one in a couple of days. Very cool. Received next movie. Watched The IT Crowd: Season 3 (2008) online. All the episodes this time had something to them, which is better than the second season, which seemed to die out fast.<br /><strong>09/20/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Oldboy (2003) again, since I saw a mention of it a while back, and wanted to verify it's a 5-star movie. It is. I'll drop off tomorrow, using a Milwaukee (3079) mailer instead of the Madison one it came in, since I still have another movie coming.<br /><strong>09/21/2009</strong> (M) - Received and watched The One-Armed Swordsman (1967), which was not only a good example of the genre, but has a good ending. After some debating, I'll use the Minneapolis MN (PO Box 9473 - 55440-8543) mailer when I put it in the mail tomorrow.<br /><strong>09/22/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Honestly, surprised they didn't wait until they received both.<br /><strong>09/23/2009</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix. Received and watched Jumanji (1995), which I haven't watched probably since it came out or first showed up on network television, but which is still really good. I'll drop off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/25/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.</p>
