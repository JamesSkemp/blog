<p>
Thanks to some great support, I&#39;m now able to log in to my Vault.&nbsp; Now that I&#39;m in, I&#39;ll be bouncing around items a bit more.&nbsp; There&#39;s also some great articles that I&#39;d like to comment on, that revolve around the project, so that&#39;ll end up meaning new philosophy-related posts (instead of just the porting-over of old ones.

Hooray!
