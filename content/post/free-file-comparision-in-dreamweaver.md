I found a great post at <a href="http://angelo.mandato.com/blog/?p=39">http://angelo.mandato.com/blog/?p=39</a>, regarding a free file comparision utility for Dreamweaver / Windows, called WinMerge (winmerge.org).<!--more--><!--adsense-->

A number of versions later, and I&#39;m still using this great little program.  Not only does it rock with Dreamweaver, it&#39;s a great stand-alone program.

However, comparing local versus remote files is still what makes this program king.
