You know what grinds my gears?
</p>
<p>
When people say that they wasted time playing a video game.
</p>
<p>
For example, &#39;I was playing Fallout 3 and it began freezing at this certain point, twenty hours in; since I can&#39;t proceed, I&#39;ve wasted twenty hours of my life.&#39;
</p>
<p>
Hello? What do you get for finishing the game? Not the hours that you spent playing it.
</p>
<p>
Or did you? If you spend 80 hours and beat a game, how is that really different? You beat it?
</p>
<p>
But isn&#39;t stopping after 20 hours because of a bug different than stopping because you got tired of the game? Sure it is. For the latter the game wasn&#39;t any fun; there&#39;s no point in wasting any more time. But for the former, the game <em>is</em> fun, and you want to spend more time with it.
</p>
<p>
But you can&#39;t. So suddenly the entire 20 hours becomes wasted time.
</p>
<p>
But then they fix the issue and you&#39;re able to continue. Yay.
</p>
<p>
But since you wasted 20 hours, why waste any more? Or did you really not waste those 20 hours? (Or did you, and wasting 20 hours wasn&#39;t a bad thing?)

Tagged <strong>xbox 360</strong> since a video on Fallout 3 freezes was the reason for this post.
