There&#39;s just something about having four different browsers on your computer, to say the least.  I do believe I&#39;ve Lynx installed as well, but it&#39;s hardly used these days ... for better or worse.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
Firefox 1.5.0.6<br />
Internet Explorer 7.0.5450.4 (i.e., 7.0 Beta 3)<br />
Opera 9.01-8552<br />
Netscape 8.1
</p>
<p>
Best of all?  My site displays great in all four.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
There are other browsers to test, of course, but the question is whether it&#39;s really necessary to do so.  Both Flock and Mozilla seem like a waste to install, since they (like Netscape) are so much fluff.
</p>
<p>
Lynx is actually a pretty good browser for a developer, and what do you know, I do have a version from 10/2005 on my computer (2.8.5rel1).

<p>
If I had a Mac, I&#39;d test my site with Safari, but alas I do not.
</p>
<p>
If I had a Linux machine that connected to the Internet (perhaps fairly soon ...) then I would test Konqueror and the like.
</p>
<p>
The lessons are two-fold.
</p>
<p>
1) If you&#39;re working on a site, test it in multiple browsers.  Honestly, with today&#39;s world, there&#39;s no reason people shouldn&#39;t upgrade to the newest version of their preferred browser.  Not only do you get better security, but you also get a better browsing experience.  I recommend Firefox, but no matter which browser you choose, if it&#39;s up-to-date, and still being supported (i.e., it&#39;s not a dead browser, but patched to the latest version), it&#39;s okay in my book (some are just better than others).
</p>
<p>
2) Keep your browser up-to-date.  You don&#39;t need to have the bleeding edge beta releases (in fact, you probably don&#39;t want to either), but at least keep your browser fully patched.  Don&#39;t like how they upgraded the browser in a future release?  It&#39;s not only selfish to keep using that old version, but also dangerous.  And you can always switch to a browser that allows more customization (like Firefox).
