                                The following is a review of The Grand Design, written by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. Who&rsquo;s the audience? While interesting, the lack of a defined audience makes this book an extremely difficult read. Having read A Brief History of Time I was looking for something with a similar feel to it. Instead the book starts out geared towards anyone with the desire to really read and understand it, then seems to leave most of that audience towards the wayside - seemingly right around when the science gets a little iffy - and then finishes geared back towards the larger audience.

                                I submit the following as a postulate: Given knowledge of the present state of affairs, we can know the future, but not the past. Of the latter we can only make guesses and assumptions, albeit educated ones, but cannot know with certainity that they were the case. Given that two vehicles are heading towards each other at speed, and neither will be able to stop in time, we can know that they will hit each other and cause a certain amount of damage, knowing the speeds they're going, the integrity of the vehicles, and etcetera.

                                The Dover Edition of The World as Will and Representation: Volume I, translated by E.F.J. Payne, suffers from a sparse table of contents, covering only the starting pages of the four books and the appendix (the index being contained in the second volume). To remedy this, I&rsquo;ve presented below an expanded table of contents for this work. Expanded Table of Contents for Volume I Translator&rsquo;s Introduction (v - xi) Preface to the First Edition (xii - xvii) Preface to the Second Edition (xviii - xxvii) Preface to the Third Edition (xxviii) Selected Bibliography (xxix - xxx) Contents, Volume I (xxxi) First Book: The World as Representation.

                                To those who cannot travel outside the normal flow of time, it matters not whether time travel is possible, for they would be unable to determine if the past had changed (assuming it even possible). This thought came to me a moment ago, as I was about to watch the eighth episode of Cosmos.

                                Image for a moment two sheets of paper. On the first we have a design of a Web page. On the second we have the code (all of it) needed to generate that page. If we were to overlap the sheets of paper, so that the design covered the code, let us imagine that the overlapping sheet's background&nbsp;would turn transparent. With this in mind, we could overlap the two sheets of paper equally, with the right side of the design's sheet overlapping the left side of the code's sheet.

                                There's a difference between self control and killing something off. Self control is when you hunger for something, but say no. Killing something off is when you no longer hunger for something. The former is a near-constant struggle, depending upon how often the hunger makes itself known, while the latter is, once the desire is killed, relatively easy, except perhaps during moments of rememberence. Trying to remember what it was like to have a hunger/desire of a particular sort, can be, at times, more painful than the desire itself.

As with the previous parts, it seems that Ayn Rand has written the final part of The Fountainhead with two people as the focus of the part. Howard Roark is associated with this part, but Gail Wynand is obviously the secondary character. Yet, Ellsworth&rsquo;s speech to Keating, which gives us a glimpse into what Ayn Rand fears, clarifies his character for us.

Having finished Part 3 of The Fountainhead in less than a day, the whole should be fairly fresh in my memory. Yet, I have a hard time putting a second name to this part, to go along with Gail Wynand&rsquo;s, and as I did for my thoughts on part 2.

                                In part 1 of this series I wrote about the first part of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Having now finished part 2, I can write on it. The following will contain spoilers. I highly recommend you do not continue if you wish to read The Fountainhead with fresh eyes. The second part of The Fountainhead is devoted to Ellsworth M. Toohey, as the subtitle suggests. This further introduces a character we had met in part one, but gives us the chance to get to know him further.

                                I've known of Ayn Rand for quite a number of years. The first time I can remember her being talked about was by a fellow philosophy student, approximately one year ahead of me, who was a rather big fan of her work. At least one professor got into arguments with this student, as she'd&nbsp;bring up&nbsp;Rand's approach. In 2002 and 2003 I read We the Living and Anthem, and enjoyed them well enough.

                                When I think of Europe I think of the U.K., France, then Germany. What about Spain though? Moving east, Japan and China, followed by North Korea. I realize that India should be on the list, but it&#39;s not one that immediately comes to mind. Africa, as a whole, is not on the list; only bad things come to mind (AIDs and spammers/scammers). Same with Israel; isn&#39;t it bad that&nbsp;I think not of religiousness, but rather of constant war?

                                the terrible thing about hell is that when you&#39;re there you can&#39;t even tell as you move through this life you love so you could be there and not even know but you say so what I&#39;m doing just fine the irony is that it&#39;s all in your mind and that&#39;s why hell is so vicious and cruel but you&#39;ll just go on an oblivious fool (Phish/Marshall. &quot;Shafty.&quot; Lyrics.

                                You know what grinds my gears? When people say that they wasted time playing a video game. For example, &#39;I was playing Fallout 3 and it began freezing at this certain point, twenty hours in; since I can&#39;t proceed, I&#39;ve wasted twenty hours of my life.&#39; Hello? What do you get for finishing the game? Not the hours that you spent playing it. Or did you? If you spend 80 hours and beat a game, how is that really different?

                                The following is a reply to a co-worker on Facebook regarding a particular topic. Since it&#39;s on Facebook, I probably can&#39;t link to it, but since I don&#39;t want to lose my response &hellip; I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t be as eloquent as everyone else; I&#39;m a little mentally drained on nights. That said, Obama called for all American&#39;s to be ready to make sacrifices. There is little doubt that greed (part of the great motivator) is what brought this country to the knee it now rests on.

                                Since college I have disliked ethics. However, I couldn&#39;t explain why. On December 10, 2008, at approximately 10:04 PM, I turned on the lamp next to my bed and wrote the following: 9 people on a boat that can only hold 8. What do you do? Even then I knew the answer. Morally, I think the answer is you (me) jump off the boat. Maybe I was reading too much Schopenhauer, but this seems like the only answer you can give.

                                While in college I heard of the Greeks who, when death was near, would throw a party. All the friends of the dying would come together to drink and merry. The dying would slit their wrists and party along with the others, his life spilling out from him all the while. While I&#39;m sure that in today&#39;s world this would never happen, my hope is that when I die those who know me will celebrate, instead of mourn.

                                Here&#39;s what my answer is: No, I did the standard Philosophy major with a minor in Humanistic Studies. In high school I liked doing Web stuff, even though my stuff was *horrible*, but I didn&#39;t want to do that for a career (hard to make a career out of something you love, and still keep that love alive - or so they say). Originally I was going for Psychology, but I was told that wouldn&#39;t be a good field for me, and my Biology grades were horrid.

                                I ran into a co-worker who suggested that&nbsp;I probably held a certain environmental view,&nbsp;because I was wearing a Grateful Dead shirt. While I knew it to be true, I&#39;d never really thought that my political views too may be out there based upon the band t-shirt that I was wearing. Wearing Grateful Dead? Liberal. Wearing Bruce Springsteen? Liberal. Wearing Fleetwood Mac? Liberal. Billy Joel? That&#39;s probably liberal as well. My co-worker Rob (looks like his domain expired)&nbsp;was wearing a OS X shirt.

                                A lot of people like to pull full passages from Waking Life, as it&#39;s a very quotable movie. However, the problem with that is that if things change there&#39;s a whole lot of sites that are out-of-date. And, sometimes people forget to add attribution ... I&#39;ve been thinking about ways to make this easier, and believe I&#39;ve come up with an idea. Looking at the numbers, I&#39;m working from the most popular to the least popular chapters, with the goal of having all available.

I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. The first version will be based almost exclusively on a subtitle rip. As I&#39;m able, I&#39;ll review the subtitles and supplement the transcript as possible. See also the Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence script.

                                I forgot to comment on this the other day, when I first read the post. Jeff Atwood, of Coding Horror,&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;piece titled&nbsp;&quot;Understanding Model-View-Controller&quot; which brought forth this response from Shmork (I wish he would have posted a site): I have to admit, as someone with more philosophical inclinations, I wonder whether the stated goal of totally separating content from representation is even a good idea. Certainly no graphic designer would sign on to that theory of the world, much less a philosophically inclined graphic designer.

                                The following book review is for the Richard E.&nbsp;Aquila translation of Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s The World as Will and Presentation, Volume One. A brief history of my previous experiences with Schopenhauer: I first read Schopenhauer&#39;s The World as Will and Representation (the Payne, definitive, translation) many years ago. I&#39;ve also read a number of Schopenhauer&#39;s other works (mostly done by Payne) and have tried to pick up as many other works of his as I can.

                                Hello, &nbsp;I noticed a very minor mistake in Volume One of The World As Will and Presentation, translated by Richard E. Aquila. I&#39;m of the tech-industry now, where errata is a necessary evil, so ... I thought I&#39;d point it out, just in case any other fixes need be made in later printings/editions. &nbsp;On page 396, in the last sentence of the first full paragraph, we have this text: &quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right the kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; &nbsp;This should in fact be (emphasis my own): &quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right *to* kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; &nbsp;If this should be forwarded to someone else, please just let me know.

                                After all the hype, I finally had the chance to actually play a demo of echochrome, the M.C. Escher-ish game that&#39;s coming out for the Playstation 3 and PSP. The first Google result, for a YouTube video, gives&nbsp;an excellent presentation of what the game is like. However, at least in the demo, the camera controls seem sluggish. Perhaps the Sixaxis motion control would make this easier - I haven&#39;t tried it yet.

                                Pre-emptive clarifications First, by a &lsquo;good man&rsquo; we specifically mean here one who is truly good. By &lsquo;good&rsquo; we mean one who, by their actions, attempts to decrease the amount of evil. By &lsquo;evil&rsquo; we mean those actions which are disruptive towards a social, unified, ordered, society. For example, murder, theft and&nbsp;pillaging. This by no means exhausts all potential issues with the below, but if one assumes the common definitions, it should make sense.

                                Recently, Gavin Schmitt asked me what my thoughts were on philosophy books about philosophers. Does that ever bother you, by the way? Philosophy books about other philosophers? Either you read it ahead of time and you don&#39;t know what the hell the author is talking about, or you read it afterwards and you end up not recalling the exact passages the author is referring to. It&#39;s like you need a FIRM grasp on the material to appreciate a book on the philosopher, but if you have that firm grasp you probably don&#39;t need to read the book (besides as a refresher).

                                In January and March of 2005, I asked Gavin Schmitt, of The Framing Business and Gavin War Journal, a number of questions. Those questions, and the respective answers, have been posted below. Since his answers may have changed since early 2005, I&#39;ll be adding any additional comments he may have to the answers below. 1) I&#39;m about to read your writings - why should I? In all honesty, you probably shouldn&#39;t.

                                In 2003, I received a bachelor&#39;s in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin: Green Bay. During my four and a half years at Green Bay, I studied a deal of philosophy, without ever really deciding that I&#39;d go for a degree in philosophy; philosophy was actually meant to just satisfy the necessary requirement of picking a degree in my sophmore year. Nonetheless, gradate with philosophy I did. During those years, I studied a number of philosophers, some more than others.

For most of us, from our earliest days we are taught that one day we will become an adult, get married, and have children. Depending upon where you grow up, what your parents think of higher education, and what their thoughts are regarding said education, going to college may also be a part of the prescribed future.

                                Question: Is my detached hand me? Id est, if someone were to cut my hand off and place it on a table, could one say that that hand is me (James Skemp)? I reply: A part of me, yes. But, so too is the rest of my, otherwise whole, body. So, saying &quot;this is x,&quot; where &#39;this&#39; refers to a part of &#39;x,&#39; no matter what the part, is the same, in some sense, of saying that of any other part.

                                In January of 2002, I bought a copy of the two volume set of Logical Investigations for a college course regarding major figures in philosophy, or some such. Later that year I picked up a copy of the Ideas, for another course, the next semester. Unfortunately, Husserl remained something of a mystery to me, despite having attempted to make my way through his primary works. With Husserl, part of Routledge&#39;s new series of introductory works on Western philosophers, David Woodruff Smith attempts to give an overview and analysis of what makes Husserl such an &#39;influential philosopher.&#39; With the hope that D.W.

She can make you dizzy, like you&#39;ve been drinking Jack all morning. She can make you feel high for the greatest commodity known to man - promise, the promise of a better day, the promise of a greater hope, the promise of a new tomorrow. This particular ore can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl - in her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing about life seem OK.

                                I&#39;ve been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since I first listened to the album Born in the USA (on cassette), way back, many, many years ago. Most of the music/songs that I enjoy are because of women, but Bruce Springsteen is one of the few artists that I enjoy because of a man. In this case, my father had the tape, but it was women who gave the music true meaning.&nbsp; Anywho ...

                                Harlan Ellison is one of those authors who not only writes interesting things, but is also quite an interesting character himself (like Chuck Palahniuk, and Philip K. Dick). One of Ellison&#39;s major themes is love. He&#39;s written a good deal about it, and while I&#39;m doing my research on love, I couldn&#39;t exclude Ellison. What follows are quotes from Ellison&#39;s pieces that reference that thing called love ... On the night that he actually paid for love, the night he physically reached into his wallet and took out two ten dollar bills and gave them to the girl, the creature took full and final shape.

                                My GitS: 2nd Gig knowledge is a bit rusty, so Solid State Society is definitely going to be one of those &#39;need to watch it at least twice&#39; movies. It seems the movie takes place after 2nd Gig, and therefore, outside of the realm of the other two movies. For two years the Major has been working outside of Section 9, which seems a bit off, since I was under the understanding (perhaps just from the movies) that if they quit, they forfeit pretty much everything ...

                                A space ship launches, and while in space, it explodes. Let us assume we can see all possible reasons it could have exploded, and we find that there is an equal chance for one of two components to fail, which therefore would have caused the explosion. In either case, the end result would have been the same, down to the smallest particle. In other words, not even a god could discern any difference between the conclusion of the explosion; everything is exactly in the same place in either case.

                                The following thoughts are from approximately 10:20 last night. While I&#39;d like to believe that technology is good, part of me believes the opposite. So close are they, in fact, that I can make no decision one way or another, try as I might. While it&#39;s true science can heal us, all too often life itself is placed above the reason for life - the reason to live. True, we will soon be living longer and longer, but at what price?

                                This weekend we went down to the Capitol for Madison&#39;s farmer&#39;s market on the square. While walking towards the square (the streets surrounding the Capitol building) I overheard a glimpse of a man&#39;s speech. While I only heard part of, and I have no idea what was going on before or after the conversation, it sounded quite like a monologue. The gist of his speech was that there&#39;s a fight to give illegal immigrants legal status in America.

    &ldquo;These wars, famines, floods and quakes meet well-defined needs. Man wants chaos. In fact, he&rsquo;s gotta have it. Depression, strife, riots, murder, all this dread. We&rsquo;re irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction. It&rsquo;s in all of us. We revel in it. Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things, painting them up as great human tragedies. But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world, no. Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them. The powers that be want us to be passive observers.&rdquo; - <cite><a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/05/25/91/waking-life-chapter-4-alienation/">Waking Life</a></cite>

Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t kept up all that much with the recent (April 17, 2007) shootings in Virginia. However, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard a disturbing trend, namely the dehumanizing and ostracizing of the shooter, Cho Seung-Hui. Quite frankly, this is disturbing.

                                In Gavin Schmitt&#39;s 2006 essay Should We Examine Life?, Gavin attempts to arrive at some solid decision on the two following questions, &quot;Is there value in examining our lives and the world around us? Is there value in ignoring our selves and our world?&quot;, having come to this questions based upon Socrates&#39; claim that &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;. However, while Gavin attempts to answer these questions, and perhaps succeeds, he opens himself up to an even larger question, which will be the topic of this essay.

                                &quot;&#39;Tis always better to be who you are, then to strive after who you may have been.&quot; Which is to say, if you ever have the chance to go back and change certain events in your past (as in, time travel), do not take it. The you that you could now be is not the you that you have become. In fact, the you that you may have become may be worse off than the you that you are, no matter what you may now believe.

(Togusa:) &quot;Are we actually back in physical reality?&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou:) &quot;There is no way to distinguish reminiscence from true memory. Whatever they are, they can only be analyzed after the fact. The passage of time itself can&#39;t be stored, so it&#39;s tough. And inevitable, now that our e-brains share external memories. Do your wife and daughter, waiting for you at home, really exist? Or are you, in reality, still single, living in some cheap rented room, only dreaming of that family. Don&#39;t you want to verify what actually happened back there?&quot;

His reputation turned to shit. Wound up your garden-variety hacker.&quot;

<p>
&quot;Sounds like quite a story.&quot;

<p>
&quot;Yeah, but no matter how far a jackass travels, it won&#39;t come back a horse. His downfall came when his reach exceeded his grasp. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

[9 Orange Sky]

<p>
&quot;This area was once intended as the Fear East&#39;s most important information center, a Special Economic Zone in its heyday. These towers survive as a shadow of the city&#39;s former glory. Its dubious sovereignty has made it the ideal haven for multi-nationals and the criminal elements that feed off their spoils. It&#39;s a lawless zone, beyond the reach of UN or E-police. Reminds me of the line, &#39;What the body creates, is as much an expression of DNA as the body itself.&#39;&quot;

Time has passed since Batou&#39;s original partner, Major Motoko Kusanagi, cybernetically enhanced to such a degree that only her &quot;ghost&quot; remained human, disappeared into the Net. Since then, Batou has wondered where her ghost might be and if the Major will ever return ...

<p>I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is an extremely philosophical movie, so I have decided to watch and type up a transcript of the movie so that I could expand my own knowledge of the film. In the spirit of the Internet/Web, I provide it here as well to aid others.</p>

I&#39;m aware that forums have been doing this for a long time, so what struck me is the forums I signed up for, but don&#39;t remember doing so :D  (That&#39;s also a little security-scary<sup><a id="link1" name="link1" href="#note1" title="link1">1</a></sup>, but I know I&#39;m signed up with many more that don&#39;t appear to be sending birthday greetings.)</p>

My hypothesis is that you can in fact judge a philosophy book by it&#39;s cover. Which is to say;</p>

Having moved from items written in January of 2006, to items written in late-2005, then to 2001, and then back to mid-2005, I have realized for myself what many have already realized.  There&#39;s a problem with the Internet.</p>

<p>Notes: Text comes from the source listed below. Highlighting is my own, as well as any indented text. The best way to use this document is to either read a copy reprinted elsewhere and then to read over this, to read the entire (non-indented) text here, with particular note of the highlighted areas, or to read this entire document, from top to bottom. The notes that I supply follow immediately after a paragraph and discuss/clarify the above paragraph. The highlighting is meant to draw attention to particular words, as I feel this is where the most importance lies.</p>

While reading a past news item regarding the <a href="http://www.wisbar.org/divisions/yld/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Young Lawyers Division of the State Bar of Wisconsin</a>, I asked myself if donating was equal to volunteering. The Young Lawyers Division (YLD) collects business clothing from lawyers to give to lawyers who cannot afford business clothing. If lawyer X donates clothing to the YLD, is lawyer X volunteering? To get to the answer to this question, I have to proof that volunteering implies, or suggests, donating, and that donating implies volunteering. If either is not the case, or if both are not the case, then volunteering is not the same as donating.</p>

                                <p>
Back on the second of February 2002, I first, as far as I can recall or prove, wrote down the question &ldquo;Is it better to live a lie, or know the truth and cry?&rdquo; The item that this was written in was an item called <em>Guide to One Philosophy of Life: Revision 1</em>, and consisted of twelve pages of material from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002. While I kept saying that I was going to get back to it and revise it, I never did.
</p>
<p>
A recent item on a LiveJournal journal, along with something I had read earlier in the day on the same area, reminded me of this quote that I had written so long ago. After some searching, I found it in the item mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
My task here is to discuss this question that I have raised. Of course, it being April 27 2005, I should point out that I do not have an answer to this question as of yet. Perhaps that suggests that I am doing more of the former than the latter, or perhaps it is because the latter has gotten me no closer to the answer of this question.

According to David Gries (via his site), logician Raymond Smullyan stated the following word problem in one of his many books, which regards lying knaves and truthful knights.

If you&rsquo;re going to read more on Arthur Schopenhauer, I suggest you start with his main works, followed by other primary resources (id est, books written by him), followed by secondary resources. 
</p>
<p>
For ease, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of books currently available to the English language reader. Obviously, if you can read German, it makes little sense to purchase any of the translations, since the language the work was written in is better suited for Schopenhauer&rsquo;s original thoughts.

                                Looking through an old philosophy anthology, Biomedical Ethics: Fifth Edition, I found and read On Lying to Patients, by Mack Lipkin. After reading this piece, I was again made to realize how much I dislike ethics. While Lipkin sets out to give us a theory, or method, he leaves us with more questions than answers. For this article, I would like to discuss whether doctors have an ethical obligation to tell the truth to their patients.

                                Have you ever visited Cliff Yablonski Hates You on SomethingAwful.com? For those of you have not, maybe you&#39;ll want to take a look, maybe you won&#39;t. Google it if you&#39;d like to see it for yourself (or just browse Something Awful), or read on. One of the easiest kinds of humour is the kind at the expense of another. Honestly, it&#39;s funny to see someone suffer some kind of hardship or accident.

                                Notes: While primarily based upon The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and Its Discontents may have crept into this discussion. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, seeing as how the latter is a sequel of the former, but if you have not read the latter, some of the ideas here may be new to you. Sigmund Freud tells us, near the end of the work, that &ldquo;the sole purpose&rdquo; of The Future of an Illusion is point out the necessity of man surmounting infantilism.

                                Listen to On the Saying &#39;God is Odd&#39; (MP3 format). An old and popular saying states that &lsquo;God is odd&rsquo;. But is there any validity to this claim? This article shows that there is indeed validity and truth to this claim. God consists, or is equal to the addition, of three characters; &lsquo;G&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, and &lsquo;d&rsquo;. If a number is not evenly divisible by two, that number is odd. Three divided by two is one-and-one-half, therefore three is not evenly divisible by two.

                                Ren&eacute; Descartes&rsquo; Meditations on First Philosophy consists of three parts; a preface to the reader, a synopsis, and the six mediations themselves.&nbsp; Heralded as the first &lsquo;modern&rsquo; thinker in philosophy, Descartes introduces the problem encompassed by &lsquo;dualism&rsquo;: how is it that mind and body can interact with each other?&nbsp; Descartes also questions how it is that we can know reality.&nbsp; While the quick answer is through our senses, depending upon our senses opens us up to questions of how we know that our senses are correct.

He described these acts of passive violence as the &quot;Seven Blunders.&quot; Grandfather gave me the list in 1947 just before we left India to return to South Africa where my father, Manilal, Gandhi&#39;s second son, and my mother, Sushila, worked for nonviolent change.

                                <p>
The reason I picked up Martin Heidegger&#39;s <cite>The Principle of Reason</cite> was quite simple - having read Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <cite>The World as Will and Representation</cite> and agreed with many of his points, I attempt to further my knowledge of his principles as much as possible. While Heidegger doesn&#39;t mention Schopenhauer a single time in his thirteen Lectures, nor in his Address, Schopenhauer certainly discusses the Principle of Reason, pulling off of Leibniz, and is therefore a blatant oversight of Heidegger&#39;s to not mention Schopenhauer at all. Whether this is unintentional one cannot know from simply the text, but for a German philosopher to not know another German philosopher who covered the same content is quite surprising, to say the very least.

                                Rest. Passivity. Inactivity. All speak of the absence of movement &ndash; the absence of activity &ndash; in common language. Yet, when I stand still is it really very different than when I am moving about? Is inactivity really the absence of activity? Let us say I am walking down the street. I see a beautiful manikin in a storefront window with short, shoulder length, red hair. While it is true that I am no longer in motion &ndash; I no longer advance down the street, I still made a choice to stop at the particular storefront window and look in.

The following is meant to be an overview of <em>The Principles of Philosophy</em>, or, the<em> Monadology</em> (1714), by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). My main interest in Leibniz is to see how his work relates to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. Any notes that I make should be read with this in mind.

                                I must admit that Robert Heilbroner&#39;s An Inquiry Into the Human Prospect was not quite the book that I thought it was going to be. The title and cover were what drew me to the book, and the back cover information had little impact, if any, because I realized after reading the book that I may not have read it... Of course, Heilbroner refers to Hobbes at least once, and Marx quite a few times, and since these two are political philosophers, and since philosophy runs through everything, I wasn&#39;t displeased with the book in the least.

                                <p>
Let&#39;s assume, firstly, that you are driving in a 55 mile per hour (mph) zone. Now, that is the speed limit, or, in other words, the limitation of traffic/vehicle speed. Now, if you are going 55 mph, then you are going 100% of the allocated speed. That is, you are going 55 in a 55 zone.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you are going 50 mph, in that same 55 mph zone, then you are going 90.90% of the allocated speed (50 / 55). So, you are going ~ 9.1% under the speed limit (5 / 55). Now, if you are going 5 mph over the speed limit, or 60 mph, then you are going ~ 9.1% over the speed limit, or, 109% of the allocated speed limit (60 / 55). Now, 109% over the posted speed limit is not that bad.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us assume that you are going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. 65 / 55 is equal to 1.18, so, you are going 118% over the speed limit. Now, what about 7 mph over the speed limit (in a 55 mph zone)? Well, 62 mph translates to ~ 113% of the speed limit, or 13% over the speed limit.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us take that 7 mph and translate it to a few different speeds, which tend to be common road speeds (at least in Wisconsin), as well as what 5 mph over the speed limit would be, as well as 10 mph over. All percentages are rounded to the nearest percent (1%) in this and in later tables.

As I said before, everything leads towards one goal, which &#39;results&#39; in the end of history. After all, the telos is final, and therefore leaves room for no other causes.

See the complete script for Waking Life. There is more to this then the discussion about God. This is packed full with a lot of various things, all of which deserve some time. I&#39;ll start with this passage first. However, before I do that, I should point out that I&#39;m not sure whether or not these two are both film directors.

As with the 19th century figure Kierkegaard, one could quite easily ask whether the 19th century writer Nietzsche is a philosopher. After all, if we compare their writings to the writings of such 19th century philosophers as Hegel and Schopenhauer, we are confronted with quite a difference. Yet, basing our decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the format of their writings is, I believe, flawed. Rather, one should base their decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the <em>content</em> of the writings. For this paper, I will be doing exactly this: I will be looking at the content of Nietzsche&#39;s writings in order to show that he is doing philosophy, and is therefore a philosopher.

                                It&#39;s said that &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned,&quot; but is that really true? How can it be that by saving something you earn it? Doesn&#39;t the fact that you already have, in this case, a penny prohibit you from earning it, since we usually give something to someone and say they earned it...? After some thought regarding this topic I have come to find a possible answer to the question of what this saying means.

                                Michael Dawson, in his book Understanding Cognitive Science attempts to provide a basic understanding of cognitive science, specifically by dealing with and using the &quot;tri-level&quot; hypothesis. For this paper, I will be discussing the tri-level hypothesis and what it tells us about cognitive science. One of the major problems in any science is the problem of discussing the findings within a set field with people outside of the field. Because of this problem, time is instead spent on some lesser subjects, such as sports and the weather.

                                I recently, while daydreaming yet again in a class, happened upon the phrase residing on the side of a McDonald&#39;s cup stating that &quot;Change is Good&quot;. I, of course, am quite familiar with this saying, however, I was a tad confused. Because of this confusion, I decided that it would be best for me to go ahead and examine the saying &quot;Change is Good&quot; in order to see just what was meant by this saying.

                                January 2, 2009: The following was written on a piece of paper I recently found (again), dated Nov 17th 2003. Might as well type them up and trash the paper &hellip; &#39;U.S.&#39; versus &#39;Them&#39; While most people believe that the popular saying &quot;us versus them&quot; means, or says, that it&#39;s you with anyone else versus those contrary to you in some regard - the &#39;thems.&#39; However, it is not so much that is you and your group versus &#39;them&#39; as it is the United States versus &#39;them&#39; - namely those that are not the allies of the United States, but sometimes even the allies of the United States.

Quite a few years ago I took a lower level Introduction to Biology course in college. While I did pretty bad in the course, I did learn quite a few things. One of the things that I learned was about the &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;. The &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;, as I now understand it - whether or not it was taught like this - is that all biological beings are born/created (not in the &#39;Creation&#39; sense, but rather as a way to express plants, which are not born, per se, and some animals, which are hatched, and are not, per se, born) with certain desires/strivings. These strivings are applicable to any, and all, biological entities. For this article, I&#39;d like to discuss the Biological Imperative in various ways. First, I&#39;d like to describe what I believe the Biological Imperative is, at it&#39;s fundamental root - at a level basic, and truly applicable, to any and all biological entities. Then, I&#39;d like to mention how culture appears to fit into all of this, bringing in Philosophy when possible and applicable.

Starting from the truth that &quot;the world is my representation&quot; [3], Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <em>The World as Will and Representation</em> lays down what Schopenhauer believes the world is. After determining that the world is not only representation, but also will, he goes on to discuss how this all works together, and how other philosophers work into this system. For this paper, I will be focusing on the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism within this work.

                                According to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the dialectic &quot;is in general the principle of all motion, of all life, and of all activation in the actual world&quot;, as well as &quot;the soul of all genuinely scientific cognition.&quot; [1: 171] In other words, Hegel believes that the dialectic is the soul - the spirit one may say - of scientific cognition, or thought, as per the second quote. Because of this, if one wants to perform science, if one wants to study, and understand, the world around oneself, the dialectic must be used, and understood.

                                &quot;Just once wouldn&#39;t you love for someone to simply show you the evidence for God&#39;s existence? No armtwisting. No statements of, &quot;You just have to believe.&quot; Well, here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons which suggest that God exists.&quot; [1] Sounds like an interesting, and bold, statement. After all, people have been attempting to prove God&#39;s existence by use of reason almost as long, and as much, as they have been using force to.

It is said that &quot;Idle Hands Are The Devil&#39;s Tools&quot;, meaning that when one is bored, one tends to get into trouble. I have a problem, or concern, with this statement however. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m bored and I end up setting fire to a kerosene soaked blanket which ends up leading to my home becoming engulfed in flames. Now, if we want to get technical, which is exactly what I want to do, then as soon as my hands are no longer idle - as soon as I begin to do something with my hands - they are not the devil&#39;s tools, right?

                                One of the most heard sayings in the customer service business is &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. The common meaning of this statement is that no matter what the customer says, they are to be treated as though they are correct. Let us take an example. Customer orders a burger with no ketchup and with no cheese. They ask for it to be this way. Then, after getting their burger, they come up to the counter and say that they didn&#39;t get the cheese on the burger, even though they asked for it.

                                Another version of this, slightly updated it seems, is also available, titled Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Summa Theologica and the Question of the Will. Whenever I think about Medieval Philosophy, from this point on after taking this class, I will also think about religion. When I think about religion I think about God and free will. So, since I need to have a topic for this final analysis, I decided that I should probably take one of these topics, and find some writer who would be the best to analysis in this area.

                                This semester, we looked at Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, Tim Crane&rsquo;s Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, and The Cambridge Companion to Husserl. Through these writings we have learned more about the Theory of Intentionality, from two different perspectives, the Analytic Philosophy tradition &ndash; as shown by Corrado and Crane &ndash; and the Phenomenological tradition &ndash; as showcased by Husserl, or, more perhaps more appropriately, the individuals writing on Husserl.

                                1. Present Algazali&rsquo;s argument for the incoherence of the philosophers and Averroe&rsquo;s response to it. Also present your own critique. Algazali, in The Incoherence of the Philosophers, argues that &ldquo;what is customarily believed to be cause and what is believed to be an effect is not necessary, according to our opinion; but each of the two [namely, cause and effect] is independent of the other.&rdquo; [1: 283] In other words, while philosophers believe that there exists such a law that if x occurs then y occurs &ndash; that there is a system of cause and effect &ndash; Algazali believes that there is no relationship between cause and effect.

                                Francis Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis was the first chosen source to read for this Age of Reason class. Bacon&#39;s work best fits as a beginning reading for various reasons, one of which is the applicability of the book as showcasing the major ideas of the Age of Reason at the beginning of their formation, in many cases. For this paper, I will begin by examining Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis, in a specific area, and then pursuing that area&#39;s progress, or reiteration, in some of the other readings from this age.

                                In this paper, I will be trying to discuss Edmund Husserl&rsquo;s theory of impossible objects and meanings in the Logical Investigations.&nbsp; His theories of experience, knowledge, truth, and fact, will also be discussed in an attempt to determine their relation to these impossible things.&nbsp; By looking at the Logical Investigations Investigation by Investigation, I hope to see where he speaks of his ideas of experience, knowledge, truth and fact.&nbsp; After looking at these ideas, I should be able to end by speaking of impossible things.

                                We often hear of the importance of one. This will briefly look at the numbers of just how important one is. After that, I&rsquo;d like to discuss this issue (knowing full well that I will end up going off on a tangent). The importance of one person when there are x people: x people % that one person equals (1/x)*100 1 100 2 50 3 33.3 4 25 5 20 6 16.6 7 14.285714 8 12.5 9 11.1 10 10 11 9.09 12 8.3 13 7.692307 14 7.142857 15 6.6 16 6.25 17 5.8823529411764705 18 5.5 19 5.263157894736842105 20 5 21 4.761904 22 4.54 23 4.347826086956521739130 24 4.16 25 4 26 3.846153 27 3.703 28 3.571428 29 3.4482758620689655172413793103 30 3.3 31 3.225806451612903 32 3.125 33 3.03 34 2.9411764705882352 35 2.857142 With these 35 results, we see that the importance of one, in percent, decreases fairly quickly, and then slowly goes lower.

                                Often times we will hear one say to another that they do not believe in God. They will then say, as a way to prove to the other that they are right, that God does not exist, that if God exists then God would have the power to strike him down, as he is a non-believer. Of course, this cannot happen for various reasons, which I will attempt to discuss below.

                                In Tim Crane&rsquo;s book, Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, we are given a contemporary look at the Analytic Tradition, and their use of the ideas of Intentionality to come to the truth about perception and thought.&nbsp; Crane attempts to explain to the reader how perception and thought are related, as well as the role of intentionality in relation to perception and thought. For the most part, when we speak of the terms &lsquo;perception&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought&rsquo; we can rely almost solely upon a particular individual.&nbsp; For example, imagine that we have one individual, whom we will call Gavin, looking at some object, which, for simplicity, we will say is a particular can of Dr Pepper sitting in front of him.

                                1. According to Augustine, God is not responsible for the existence of evil. What is his argument? Present the argument in detail. In On Free Will, Augustine speaks of man&rsquo;s freedom to will, or make decisions, for himself. He also speaks of evil, and how a man can do evil, as well as where evil comes from. Now, Augustine believes that man is inclined to do Good, which is to follow God and seek out happiness, through virtuous activity, and not through the goods of this physical world.

                                The following is a paper written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. Every time I heard someone speak of scholasticism I never quite knew what they meant. Having heard of it in many classes in the philosophy of religion &lsquo;genera&rsquo;, I was convinced that it was something that refers to philosophers who dealt with the philosophy of religion, and specifically in the time period of the medieval era &ndash; especially around the years of St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine.

                                This paper was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. The material of this text analysis will be Peter Abailard and his work The Glosses of Peter Abailard on Porphyry. As Abailard tells us, &ldquo;There are then three questions, as Boethius says, secret and very useful and tried by not a few philosophers, but solved by few. The first is as follows, namely, whether genera and species subsist or are placed in the naked understandings alone, etc., as if he were to say: whether they have true being or whether they consist in opinion alone.

                                In Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, we are introduced to the analytical tradition in a way that has not been attempted since the time of this book. Instead of bundling philosophical works into an anthology Corrado attempts to explain what the fundamental characteristics are that tie these thinkers together. For this paper, I focus solely on the problems of perception and thought in the earlier analytic tradition, as Corrado discusses in this work, particularly on the first part, in which he discusses the background of the tradition &ndash; and therefore the earlier tradition.

                                The following was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. In Augustine&rsquo;s The City of God, Augustine discusses what he thinks the City of God would be like. While there is no one particular page or passage that especially stuck out for me, I&rsquo;m going focus on what Augustine says about other gods/religions and how that compares to what many people think in today&rsquo;s society. For this analysis, I would like to show some of the reasons that I think this.

                                For over 2500 years, philosophers have debated on such issues as rights, reality, freedom, and justice. In all of those years, one decision on what is meant by these terms has never been set in stone; a final definition - or answer - has never been reached. Therefore, when someone asks the philosopher, or even one who has merely studied philosophy, what justice is, or what any of the other terms mean exactly, there is typically not one answer that is prevalent to all.

                                Edmund Husserl, in his Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy, begins by discussing natural cognition and experience. Husserl explores experience, believing that experience is how we view the world around us. However, it is not enough to know that experience gives us insight. According to Husserl, we must, primarily, know how we are conscious of the world around us, before we can talk about the actuality of what we see.

                                The nineteenth century could be described as containing three major movements; Romanticism, Realism, and Modernism. Each movement has its own important features and major themes that have had an effect on the present day world. If I had to state one of the major themes of the entire nineteenth century, it would be the increase of the power of man and science. The beginning of the nineteenth century saw writers such as Mary Shelley, with her work Frankenstein.

                                Part I The question of what it is that makes one particular experiment ethical while another is unethical is a troublesome question. Is the ethicalness of a scientific experiment based upon whether the subject is harmed, whether the subject&#39;s rights have been in some way infringed upon, or is it based upon some other criteria? In this paper, I will take the position that it is not whether the subject was harmed, or whether their rights were infringed upon, but rather that it is ultimately power that determines the ethicalness of an experiment (position IV).

                                One of the most prevalent themes in the readings for this class has been religion, or mysticism, and its influence on and necessity for both man and society. The question that keeps arising is, however, can man and society live do without religion, or something similar? The modern man has more trust, for the most part, in science then he has in religion. However, what does this mean? First, I would like to take a look at what religion has done for man, in relation to the readings in general.

                                See also my paper tiled: Philosophy, Politics, and Law Final Regarding Justice and Various Philosophers. For my paper, I was going to attempt to answer what justice is. Obviously, Plato&#39;s Republic will be of use for this topic. Particularly his discussion with others, as well as how he thinks the state should be setup. I&#39;m not going to put any of Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince in my paper, because I wasn&#39;t too much of a fan of him, and he doesn&#39;t really go into what justice &#39;really&#39; is.

                                <p>Recently, while listening to a philosophical discussion, I came to hear that there were not two kinds of inference (deductive and inductive), as I thought before, but instead that there were three kinds; deductive, inductive, and abductive. Wanting to know more about abductive reasoning, I did a little search, finding the following information.</p>

                                In his Notes from Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky asks what it is that civilization, or society in general, gives to the individual. In essence, the question concerns where the individual resides in society; what can be learned from man&#39;s place in a society? Dostoevsky presents to the reader a conflicted, sickly individual, and explores why the individual is the way he is, as well as whether society could do anything to help him from his lowly state.

                                <p>It is important to mention what sentential logic is. While my guide has been out for almost two years now, I&rsquo;ve yet to discuss what these rules are for. Sentential logic is one logical system, by which conclusions can be reached via premises, which may or may not be true. The truth of the premises does not concern sentential logic. Rather, sentential logic will tell you what conclusions necessarily come from the premises posited.</p>

First, I will discuss Flew&rsquo;s major contribution, which is the analogy of the gardener. Second, I will discuss why this analogy helps to show that religious claims make no assertions, and are instead mere utterances. Flew begins his piece with a parable.

                                The following was written from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002, but I am just now (January 30, 2009) getting around to posting this. I can honestly admit that I haven&#39;t read over this in a very long time, but the skimming that I have done reminds me of certain things ... As time progresses I may go back and re-purpose this content. (Of particular note, also, will be at what time these were written and when I was reading certain philosophical works.) One has to question many of the things that many people take as being commonplace, or common knowledge.

                                Descartes&rsquo; rationalist notion of necessary and contingent connections between simple natures has an important role in his Meditations. This, in turn, has an impact on other philosophers to come, in relation to the problems that the Meditations raise. This paper will first deal with simple natures, their connections, and their role in Descartes&rsquo; Meditations. After looking at Descartes, three other philosophers will be looked at to see how they deal with the ideas brought up by Descartes.

                                For this paper, I would like to focus on the topic of conflict and the ruler from the view of Confucianism.&nbsp;Specifically, I would like to look on how a ruler should operate, and under what conditions conflict, or war, should occur.&nbsp;By looking at the Analects, the Book of Mencius, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Great Learning, I hope to gain some insight into the relationship between these two subjects.

                                &ldquo;Let us suppose that organ transplant procedures have been perfected; in such circumstances if two dying patients could be saved by organ transplants then, if surgeon have the requisite organs in stock and no other needy patients, but nevertheless allow their patients to die, we would be inclined to say, and be justified in saying, that the patients died because the doctors refused to save them. But if there are no spare organs in stock and none otherwise available, the doctors have no choice, they cannot save their patients and so must let them die.&rdquo; (Harris, 257) This, the start of John Harris&rsquo; article, gives a possible future situation that seems to be straightforward, in that most of us would find that the first situation would be a case of a &lsquo;wrongful&rsquo; death, and the second a case of unfortunate circumstances.

                                From the introductory material, we learn that the Great Learning &quot;gives the Confucian educational, moral, and political programs in a nutshell&quot; (1: 84). These ideas are summed up as, and consist of; manifesting the clear character of man, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good. There are also eight steps that should be followed; &quot;the investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of the will, rectification of the mind, cultivation of the personal life, regulation of the family, national order, and world peace&quot; (1: 84).

                                This semester we have looked at many different philosophers from the pre-Socratic up to Aristotle. For this paper, I will be talking about Aristotle&rsquo;s Nichomachean Ethics and my view of what Aristotle states in this work. Specifically, I will be focusing on his view of happiness and comparing it with my view on happiness. Aristotle first begins Nichomachean Ethics by giving a definition of the good. &ldquo;The good, therefore, has been well defined as that at which all things aim.&rdquo; (Baird, 364) He also states, &ldquo;In cases where the end lies beyond the action the product is naturally superior to the activity&rdquo; (Baird, 364), meaning that the product of an action is more important then the action itself.

                                So far this semester, we have looked at four different writers of the Renaissance period. Of all of them, I personally found Montaigne to be the most interesting and appealing author. For this final paper, I will be discussing Montaigne&rsquo;s use of the self and the main points of the pieces that we read, followed by what I think about Montaigne&rsquo;s writing. The first piece that we read by Montaigne was Essay 14 in Book I: &ldquo;That the taste of good and evil things depends in large part on the opinion we have of them&rdquo;.

                                For my chapter synopsis, I read Chapter XIX. Of the Dissolution of Government for John Locke. This chapter deals with dissolving the government; how governments are dissolved, and what do to when they are. He says that governments are either overturned from without, or from within. When a foreign force conquests the commonwealth, the current government can not survive. Therefore, we return to the state of nature, and are free to survive alone, or find another way to survive, with another government.

                                The following paper was written for an Ancient Philosophy course that I took in college. I have not reviewed it since. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato about Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played in not only the past, but also the influence that he has today. In this paper, I will be discussing the main reasons that Socrates had such an influence on philosophy.

                                This was the first attempt&nbsp;at The Importance of Socrates. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato on Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played not only in the past, but also the influence that he has today. From Plato, we are able to learn some of the reasons that Socrates is important. In this paper, I&rsquo;ll be discussing the main reasons that Socrates was persecuted, in the hopes that this will shed some light on why he was so important.

To sum it up very shortly, free will. Throughout the book, Erasmus is trying to show us that the Bible is filled with examples that strength the idea that an individual has free will, or the choice to do as they want, whether it be good or evil.

                                &ldquo;Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.&rdquo; (Rousseau, Chapter I). Jean-Jacques Rousseau and The Social Contract had a large impact on Western Civilization in the late 18th century. Rousseau based his ideas on some of the writings of previous philosophers, trying to form a good political theory. The Social Contract was developed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau around 1762, during the time of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. The Social Contract was based on the ideas of Baron de Montesquieu and John Locke.
