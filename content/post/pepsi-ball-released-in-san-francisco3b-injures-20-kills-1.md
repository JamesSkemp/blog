<p>At approximately 2:30 Sunday afternoon a Pepsi Ball was spotted around 10 Market St in San Francisco. The Ball, which eventually killed Noah Ridge, 27, continued on it's rampage in the area, striking multiple vehicles.</p>
<p>By the time the rolling rampage was over, $250,000 in property damages, 20 injured, and a nation lies in shock.</p>
<p>At the time of this article, Pepsi Co. refused to return our calls.</p>
<p>Our assesement? Pepsi, fitting its marketing, once again show contempt for those outside of its shareholders.</p>
<p>Whether the city of San Francisco will be forced to front the bill, or Pepsi Co will stand up to the plate, we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>This man's opinion? San Francisco, like Chicago and Orlando before it, will be left with the bill.&nbsp;</p>
