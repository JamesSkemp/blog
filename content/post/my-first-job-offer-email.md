It&#39;s definitely a form email, with some major spacing issue. However, the email itself is pretty concise and to the point.

ColdFusion development, in California. I like the first line, &quot;<span>It is time to come out and join the rest of the people escaping the cold.</span>&quot; but they clearly don&#39;t know me. If anything, I&#39;ll move further north :D

Thankfully, I&#39;m pretty happy where I am now, although it looks like I&#39;ll be pulling in a deal of extra hours this week. But, our new Producer is pretty on-the-ball, so I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be stepping into my new responsibilities almost completely within a month or two.

Best of all, I had two packages and another mailer by my door when I finally made it home tonight. Unfortunately, I got home late enough, and will be&nbsp;going in early enough tomorrow,&nbsp;that I won&#39;t be able to do much more than watch this Nova (?) special on samurai swords, followed by House, followed by plenty of sleep. Thankfully, my headache is finally going away, but I forgot my USB drive at work, which means I can&#39;t download and do a quick parse of the logs for today, tomorrow ...
