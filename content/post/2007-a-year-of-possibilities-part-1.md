2007 is on it&#39;s way in the door, so it&#39;s time to be thinking about where I&#39;d like to be at year&#39;s end. This time I&#39;ll be looking at what I&#39;d like to fill out my apartment with, since a number of essentials, and non-, are missing.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
1) Two side tables.  One for my bedroom, with a drawer near the top for my wallet, keys, and etcetera, and high enough that I can put my alarm clock on and see it.  The second can be a little squatter, since it&#39;ll rest in my living room.
</p>
<p>
2) A couch.  I&#39;ve got a futon in my living room now, but it&#39;s a hassle for watching much of anything, unless you&#39;re laying down.
</p>
<p>
3) A projector?  I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of a projector, instead of a TV, for a little while now.  Why bother with a new television, when I can pick up a projector and watch tv, movies, and games on one of my rather bare walls?  Heck, a semi-decent screen could even be purchased ...
</p>

	<em>Update: Mark posted a recommendation in the comments for a very nice projector, for a very nice price.  Not quite out yet, but I think I may just have found the first thing on my list ...</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
4) Shows on DVD - Miami Vice Season 3, CSI Season 5 +, House Season 3?  It&#39;s questionable how many of these will be released by 2007, but these are what I&#39;m looking for.
</p>
<p>
5) Games.  Wii, once the price goes down a bit more, and they become easier to find.  Kingdom Hearts II, once it sells new for $19.99 (GameStop and Best Buy appear to have no in-store stock, so that&#39;s a very good sign), and a handful of other PlayStation games, mostly RPGs (since length does matter, and most RPGs have hours of game-play).
</p>
<p>
6) Small table for my kitchen.  I&#39;m lacking on shelf and counter space, and desperately need something for in the kitchen.  I don&#39;t have a whole lot of space, so the &#39;table&#39; needs to be tall and skinny.  The two walls I have have heaters near the floor, so that limits my options.  I&#39;m thinking an open metal-framed &#39;thing&#39; that I can throw a nice piece of cloth over, and then use shelves inside to hold my stuff ...  Any ideas?  (Photos to come.) <em>(Added 12/31/2006)</em>

I figure if I can save $50-$100 dollars a month, I can pick up three or four items during the course of the year ...  Donations via PayPal are accepted - link in the footer of every page. ;)

Of course, what I&#39;m really looking for is recommendations (particularly for the projector - which I&#39;ve received) or your own lists.  What are the handful of things that you&#39;ve been wanting, or needing, that you&#39;d like to pick up this year?
