<p>
I don&#39;t really believe in making New Year&#39;s resolutions, since it&#39;s something people do, knowing that they&#39;re going to fail at. In my opinion.
</p>
<p>
So, for my 28th, I&#39;m doing something a little different, in that I&#39;m declaring that I will continue to do what I&#39;ve been doing, for a couple of key items.
</p>
<h3>No more soda</h3>
<p>
I&#39;ve been off soda for a couple of months, and before that I was down to just one-ish a day. I will continue to stay away from soda. Since I don&#39;t drink alcohol either, that typically means water. Juice is okay, but I don&#39;t usually drink it. Sports drinks, in particular Gatorade, are my back-up.
</p>
<h3>Suggested serving size for chocolate, if that</h3>
<p>
When you&#39;re a kid, you&#39;ll eat as much chocolate as you can. When you&#39;re an adult, things aren&#39;t much different.&nbsp;I&#39;ve cut back extremely on chocolate, and all sweets, and will continue to do so.
</p>
<h3>At least one new album&nbsp;purchase a month, by a group I don&#39;t already have</h3>
<p>
Ambitious this, but with iTunes the way it is, this should be completely possible. I&#39;m going to strive to get an album by a group that I don&#39;t already have, but realize that I may slip. There&#39;s so much good music out there that I really should get to know.
</p>
<h3>Walk at least two miles a week</h3>
<p>
In Wisconsin our winters can get cold.&nbsp;Nonetheless, I want to&nbsp;make this a year-round deal. Thus far approximately once a week I&#39;ve gone for a 1 mile walk, and want to continue to do so. I used to walk a lot during school (college and pre-) and when I lived downtown (both years), but have slacked off in the last couple of years. No more.
</p>
<h3>Write one thing a day</h3>
<p>
I&#39;m not putting a size on this, but it must be something personal. Ideally, I&#39;d like to record the year, so I can look back at the year and remember.
</p>
