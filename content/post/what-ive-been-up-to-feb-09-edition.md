<p>
As my last post may have suggested ... I&#39;ve been playing games. 
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a small taste of the games currently on my plate. 
</p>
<h3>Playstation 2</h3>
<p>
<strong>Shadow Hearts: From the New World</strong> was close to completion .. before I bought an Xbox 360. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Persona 3: Fes</strong> still remains to be started, and&nbsp;ditto for <strong>Persona 4</strong> ... Yes, I didn&#39;t even start Persona 4. Yes, I know how good reviews said it is. (I did pre-order it, after all.) 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disgaea</strong> needs to be &#39;finished,&#39; and <strong>Disgaea 2</strong> needs to be started. 
</p>
<p>
While I didn&#39;t finish the first, I pre-ordered <em>Devil Summoner 2</em> ... How could I not? If it&#39;s great, I&#39;d never be able to get a copy again. 
</p>
<h3>Playstation 3</h3>
<p>
I just picked up <strong>Flower</strong> the other day, and really enjoyed it. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Disgaea 3</em> has been out for a while, and they&#39;re releasing questionable character packs, but ... it&#39;s still supposedly a solid game. Need to pick up a copy ...
</p>
<h3>Xbox 360</h3>
<p>
<strong>Lost Odyssey</strong> is my current game of choice. Maybe a week more for that to be finished. 
</p>
<p>
I should get further in <strong>Skate</strong>, but it&#39;s certainly not Tony Hawk ... This might be a rainy day game. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Blue Dragon</strong> and <strong>Infinite Undiscovery</strong> need to be started. Probably once I finished Lost Odyssey I&#39;ll do so. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fallout 3</strong> seemingly still has a couple of major bugs. This the only reason I haven&#39;t been playing it as much as I&#39;d like; it&#39;s really a pretty awesome game. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Fable 2</em>, also seemingly had bugs, but they may be fixed? If so, this sounds like a definite buy.
</p>
<h3>Others that I missed</h3>
<p>
After writing this, I realized I missed a couple.
</p>
<p>
<em>Valkyria Chronicles</em> (Playstation 3) has been getting very good reviews, and the demo I played wasn&#39;t too shabby.
</p>
<p>
I played the demo for <em>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</em>&nbsp;for the Playstation 3,&nbsp;and&nbsp;was tempted. All things being equal, this is probably something I&#39;ll pick up for the Xbox 360&nbsp;at some point. (For the power aspect, not the Star Wars/George Lucas aspect.)
</p>
<p>
<em>Tales of Vesperia</em> (Xbox 360) has gotten &#39;eh&#39; reviews, but I starred it for some reason ... probably a video review.
</p>
<p>
<em>Lost Planet</em> (Xbox 360) and <em>The Last Remnant</em> (Xbox 360) are for picking up when they&#39;re cheap, since the last is supposedly pretty &#39;eh,&#39; while the second has graphics issues, and needs a patch.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Even though life is merely striving, it&#39;s good to know that I won&#39;t suffer from boredom on account of not having enough video games to enjoy ...
