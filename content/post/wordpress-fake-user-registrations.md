<p>
For the past couple days I&#39;ve noticed a rash of fake user account&#39;s being created.&nbsp; I wonder if this isn&#39;t meant to be some new way to possibly exploit WordPress.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve kept the original emails I received from WordPress, and am very tempted to delete the accounts.&nbsp; However, WordPress only seems to allow the deletion of accounts.&nbsp; What if I want to &#39;ban&#39; an account/username/email?
</p>
<p>
I suppose I&#39;ll have to go find a plugin, or build one myself.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve Akismet installed, so there&#39;s been no spam yet (other than the usual questionable ones that get reported), but ...

<p>
The common thread was all emails contained the web.de domain.
</p>

<p>
The solution was to ultimately stop registrations.&nbsp;
