<p>
I have a 2007 VW Rabbit, which, in the glove compartment, has an auxillary input jack. Since I also have an iPod Classic, I really wanted to be able to listen to my music in my car, using my car&#39;s speakers. 
</p>
<p>
On January 5, I picked up&nbsp;this cable. It&#39;s a cable, so there&#39;s not a whole lot that they can mess up. From what I can tell, the quality coming out of my speakers is the same as when I use by earbuds or another set of good headphones. As such, I&#39;d say this is a very good set of cables, that works as expected. 
</p>

The one issue I did run into is that the cable can get a little inflexible. However, I&#39;ve only noticed this during cold Wisconsin days, and it had no impact on the sound quality. Also, once the cable got warmer, it was once again flexible.
