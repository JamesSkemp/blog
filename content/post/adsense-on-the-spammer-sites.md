It&#39;s about time one of the heavy hitters realizes what some of us smaller hitters have realized a long time ago; cut out a spammer&#39;s revenue, you hit the spammer the only place they care about - their wallets.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

<a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/05/15/hurting-comment-spammers/">Hurting Comment Spammers</a> links to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/05/15/hitting-comment-spammers-and-plagiarists-where-it-hurts/">Hitting Comment Spammers and Plagiarists where it Hurts</a>, where the author discusses reporting spammers to AdSense.  Again, it&#39;s about time one of larger 2.0 advocates starts injecting a worthwhile idea in the hive.

<p>
Honestly, I&#39;m being harsh, but this is something that a number of people have already been doing.  After all, spammers don&#39;t make their money out of thin air anymore - the dot-com burst the bubble, and with the new bubble, it&#39;s not quite so easy to get a ton of money out of investors.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I hope this catches on with the hive.  I&#39;d like to see the advocates create a site where this information can be tracked.  As I said in a comment to the first linked site above, we need to track what sites we&#39;re reporting, and get enough people to make it count.  I report sites when I see them, but I don&#39;t hear anything back, and when I report a site, but 2-3 weeks later see the site still using ads inappropriately, I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m really making a difference, or being listened to.  I&#39;ll still keep reporting, but, it&#39;s time for this to be injected into the group-think.

I really dislike writing about Web 2.0 ...

Which is to say, sorry if I step on any toes in this post, but sometimes I&#39;m disappointed that it takes this long for people to see methods that can benefit a group of people outside of the Web 2.0 community.

WordPress is a great example: Sure, you can use it in it&#39;s standard sense, or you can use it as a pretty good CMS - like what I did for The Framing Business.

Heck, even a wiki can do some good ...
