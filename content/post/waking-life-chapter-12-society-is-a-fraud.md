<p>
Notes: Special thanks to Andrew, Larry Redden, and Ed Sandberg for pointing out errors in Tara&#39;s transcription (numerous errors were fixed here, along with some scene information clarifications). Absolutely let me know if anything slipped by my look-over, especially in the quicker and the &#39;like, like, you know,&#39; sections ;)

</p>
<p>
On the way to discovering what we love, we will find everything we hate, everything that blocks our path of what we desire. 
</p>
<p>
The comfort will never be comfortable for those who seek what is not on the market. 
</p>
<p>
A systematic questioning of the idea of happiness. 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll cut the vocal chords of every empowered speaker. We&#39;ll yank the social symbols through the looking glass We&#39;ll devalue society&#39;s currency. 
</p>
<p>
To confront the familiar. 
</p>
<p>
Society is a fraud so complete and venal that it demands to be destroyed beyond the power of memory to recall its existence. 
</p>
<p>
Where there is fire, we will carry gasoline. 
</p>
<p>
To interrupt the continuum of everyday experience and all the normal expectations that go with it. 
</p>
<p>
To live as if something actually depended on one&#39;s actions. 
</p>
<p>
To rupture the spell of the ideology of the commodified consumer society so that our repressed desires of a more authentic nature can come forward. 
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate the contrast between what life presently is and what it could be. 
</p>
<p>
To immerse ourselves in the oblivion of actions and know we&#39;re making it happen. 
</p>
<p>
There will be an intensity never before known in everyday life to exchange love and hate, life and death, terror and redemption, repulsions and attractions. 
</p>
<p>
An affirmation of freedom so reckless and unqualified, that it amounts to a total denial of every kind of restraint and limitation. 
</p>

(The same four guys see an old man up on a telephone pole.) 
</p>
<p>
Hey, old man, what you doin&#39; up there? 
</p>
<p>
Well, I&#39;m not sure. 
</p>
<p>
You need any help getting down, sir? 
</p>
<p>
No, don&#39;t think so. 
</p>
<p>
Stupid bastard. 
</p>
<p>
No worse than us. He&#39;s all action and no theory. We&#39;re all theory and no action.

(The same four guys see an old man sitting at a bench) 
</p>
<p>
Why so glum, Mr. Debord? 
</p>
<p>
What was missing was felt irretrievable. The extreme uncertainties of subsisting without working made excesses necessary and breaks definitive. To quote Stevenson: &quot;Suicide carried off many. Drink and the devil took care of the rest.&quot;
