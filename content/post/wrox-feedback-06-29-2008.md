<div class="note">
<p>
Read my review of <a href="/words/post/Review-Beginning-ASPNET-35-In-C-and-VB.aspx">Beginning ASP.NET 3.5: In C# and VB</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Some errata for 978-0-470-18757-9, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470187573?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Professional ASP.NET 3.5 In C# and VB</a>: 
</p>
<p>
pg 247, second to last sentence on the page: &lt;h3&gt; should be &lt;h1&gt;. 
</p>
<p>
pg 253: Figure 5-13 is incorrect. 
</p>
<p>
pg 487: Figure 9-12 is incorrect. 
</p>
<p>
pg 527, second to last sentence on the page: Listing 10-13 contains no highlighted text. 
</p>
<p>
I was expecting more errata to be listed. I guess I&#39;ll have to start writing down more of the errors as I find them instead of just grumbling ... ;) 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also got one for 978-0-470-18759-3, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/047018759X?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Beginning ASP.NET 3.5: In C# and VB</a>: 
</p>
<p>
pg 372, description column for varchar / nvarchar: Shouldn&#39;t nchar be nvarchar?
