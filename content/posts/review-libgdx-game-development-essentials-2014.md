<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784399299?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">LibGDX Game Development Essentials</a>, written by Juwal Bose, and released in December 2014 by Packt Publishing.</p></div>

<h3>Difficult to follow, but not a complete waste of time</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784399299?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">LibGDX Game Development Essentials</a> is hard to follow along with, and since I'm one of those learners who likes to follow along when I'm learning a technology, that made this book troublesome.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I certainly got something out of the book, and successfully got a glimpse of just how powerful LibGDX is.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, glossing over pieces of code, combined with incomplete (or usually just vastly different) code (and assets) in the downloadable zip files, made for a read that was just plain difficult to follow. These aren't merely typos, but rather like either the code or book was revised independently of each other.</p>

<p>The book focuses on a single project over its course, which is something I generally like, as it means the project is built upon and expanded. In this case it's a Flappy Bird clone, although it seems to be more of a tweaking of the LibGDX demo "<a href="https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood" rel="external">The plane that couldn't fly good</a>." Over the course of the book you learn the ins-and-outs of LibGDX as you create this, primarily from scratch (minus easy to obtain graphics).</p>

<p>Going merely with the flow of the book, it certainly does a good job of walking you through the process from initial creation to launch on the Google Play store (as well as a look at Apple's App store - that's all I can say as I  skimmed over that particular section). I feel confident enough after reading this book that I could successfully go through that entire process (start to finish). And I have a firm grasp of what LibGDX can do.</p>

<p>But I am glad that I picked up two other LibGDX books, as this one just wasn't ideal enough.</p>

<p>While Juwal Bose certainly seems to know LibGDX, code confusion ultimately renders <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784399299?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">LibGDX Game Development Essentials</a> a solid 3 of 5 stars.</p>

<p>Depending upon how the other books I purchased are, this review may be appended to in the future. I'll also note that previous to this I read most of Kevin Brothaler's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937785343?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">OpenGL ES 2 for Android</a>, which is an awesome book. However, given the power of the LibGDX tool, I don't see myself continuing down that path much further.</p>
