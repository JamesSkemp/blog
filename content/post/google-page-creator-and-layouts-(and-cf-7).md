I got my Google Page Creator invite a short time ago, and just setup my account (less than 2 minutes ago, as of this writing).

I haven&#39;t had much time to play around with it, obviously, but I&#39;m impressed by the sample layouts they have.  I might actually bounce around a little bit, until I find one that I can make my own.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

<p>
That&#39;s been my weakest point, as I&#39;m concerned more with function than design, to a certain extent.  Design is of course important, but I&#39;m not too concerned with the beauty of the design, as much as being functional and useable.

To throw some keywords into this post, I&#39;ve been reading the <cite>ColdFusion MX 7 Web Application Construction Kit</cite> for the last couple of hours.  I&#39;m on Chapter 6, having read the intro and skipped Chapter 2 (Dreamweaver MX 2004 setup - I have 8, so why bother with the previous version, which I don&#39;t have - and I&#39;ve already setup sites and the like in 8, so ...).  I&#39;ve got a couple notes - three quarters of a page - and I felt a couple of times like I was studying for a class back in school.  It&#39;s actually a fairly nice feeling ...
</p>
<p>
Once I&#39;ve finished grabbing what I can from this book, I&#39;ll work on the other one that I&#39;ve got sitting on the top of my &#39;cabinet&#39; at work.  We don&#39;t have ColdFusion MX 7 (6.1, which is why I installed 6.1 at home), but much of the material should be relevant.  However, it has made me think that I probably should just upgrade my local installation to CF 7 ...  Of course, I&#39;ve already gone through the steps of setting of 6.1, and I still think that there&#39;s more on 6.1 than 7.
</p>
<p>
Yet, at the same time, it would be nice to have knowledge of the current version, and read up on new enhancements ...
</p>
<p>
Really, I should just upgrade now and get it done with.  I&#39;ve just got to find a free host for ColdFusion first, to set that final stone in place.  If I can&#39;t find one, then 7 it is.  If I can find one, then I&#39;ll have to go with what they go with.
