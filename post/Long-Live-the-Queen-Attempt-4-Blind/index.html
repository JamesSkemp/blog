        <p>Week 0</p><p>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: We're almost home. Your room is just the way you left it.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: *sigh*<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br/> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br/>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br/>Player chose: I've played this before<br/><hr/>Week 1<br/><br/>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I love this room! It's so much bigger than mine back home.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You should visit more often. It's awful that the only time I get to see you is...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ... something like this.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I know your brother and sister are still too young, but why haven't you come to school?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: My mother worries about me. She doesn't think anywhere but home is safe.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I understand. I'm probably not going to be allowed to leave this castle until my birthday.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: But at least we can have fun together here!<br/><hr/>Week 2<br/><br/>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br/>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br/>Player chose: Send her away<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You heard my father - get out! Leave and don't come back!<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: As you wish. I will return to my duchy, until you call for me.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: She won't.<br/> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br/><hr/>Week 3<br/><br/>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br/> You may now play Sports on the weekends.<br/>(Studied Lore in the afternoon.)<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Me too.<br/> You gather your skirts and prepare to sit down, when all of a sudden, a hissing noise alerts you to a hidden danger - a snake!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Charlotte, don't move!<br/> With your quick reflexes, you grab a forked stick and manage to flip the snake away from you and your cousin.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: EEEEEK!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Get away, you horrible thing!<br/> You stomp loudly on the ground, and the snake slithers off into the distance.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What is going on out here?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Mummy, there was a snake!<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What was a snake doing in the royal gardens? This is completely unacceptable. You could have been killed!<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Elodie scared it off.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: That's not good enough. I can't have my daughter remaining in such a dangerous place! We are returning home to Merva at once.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Awww....<br/> You creep through the castle dungeons, catching glimpses here and there of the fate that awaits troublemakers in this kingdom. Even nobles can end up here, sometimes. It's a good reminder to stay on the straight and narrow.<br/><hr/>Week 4<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Court Manners in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad? What really happened to Mom?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: She was a Lumen, a magic-user. It was meant to be in reserve, to defend our domain, but she insisted on...<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: ... you don't need to hear that.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: She used magic. It drained her strength. She thought it was harmless, and it wasn't. Eventually, her heart just... stopped.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: That's why I don't want you involved with it.<br/><hr/>Week 5<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br/>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We have a Duke of Sedna?<br/>Alice: ... No, my Lady. The duchy of Sedna is in Talasse.<br/>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It might not be appropriate for me to wear a man's gift in public, though. People would think it meant something.<br/>Menu: [Wear it] [Don't wear it] <br/>Player chose: Don't wear it<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's important to maintain the proper image.<br/> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 6<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Your Royal Highness. I would speak with you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What is it?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: There are questions you have not yet thought to ask. You know that the powers of a Lumen should be yours. Why have you not sought your crystal?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father said I shouldn't get involved in magic.<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: If you don't, who will defend your domain if the krakens rise again?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I have seen signs of the future. Danger is coming. I can teach you to control your powers, but first, you must seize your birthright and become a Lumen.<br/>Menu: [I won't do it] [I will do it] <br/>Player chose: I will do it<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: How do I do that?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: You must find the royal crystal. Speak to your father - he will know where it is.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad, what happened to Mom's Lumen crystal?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It's in a safe place.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Can I have it?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: But it's mine!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Meddling with magic killed your mother. I don't want that to happen to you.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Once you're crowned Queen, I can't stop you from doing anything you want, but for now you are still a child.<br/><hr/>Week 7<br/><br/>(Studied Lore in the morning.)<br/>(Studied World History in the afternoon.)<br/> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br/> You swiftly step aside and let her pass.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father says I can't have the crystal until I'm Queen. He's hiding it somewhere. What do I do?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I will search for it.<br/> She brings out a black bowl filled with water and stares into its depths. You look as well, but you see nothing but your own reflection.<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The crystal is kept in the treasury, under guard. They have been ordered to keep you out. You must find a way past this obstacle.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Like what?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Use your skills to convince them to stand aside, or else dispose of them.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Their lives are a small price to pay for the safety of your domain. You must have that crystal.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is she serious? She wants me to kill my own guards?)<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Try to reach the crystal. If you fail, speak to me again and I will help you to do what needs to be done.<br/><hr/>Week 8<br/><br/>(Studied Accounting in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br/>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br/>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br/>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know much about factories or trade. Would that really be worthwhile?)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 9<br/><br/>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I know there's been some problems with Ixion, but I don't know the details. I guess they're occupying southern Maree.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything about the military. I don't want to fight.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might say so, you are looking particularly lovely this day. I hope you will think fondly of me.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is he flirting with me? He's almost as old as my father!)<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 10<br/><br/>(Studied Novan History in the morning.)<br/> Your skill in Novan History is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other History skills are 25 or higher.<br/>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hellas and Maree are neighboring duchies. Together, the siblings Brin and Banion govern most of Southern Nova.)<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br/>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br/>Player chose: Bluff / Intimidate<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are trespassing on our lands. You will withdraw your troops at once. Only then will we have peace.<br/>Menu: [Threaten to attack] <br/>Player chose: Threaten to attack<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: My soldiers are poised to destroy you. Withdraw now.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Then I'm very sorry we were not able to come to an agreement.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I guess now we have to fight.)<br/> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br/><hr/>Week 11<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/> You receive a report on the outcome of the battle against the Ixionites.<br/> You succeeded in driving them out of Maree, but it cost you almost a full battalion of soldiers and a great deal of materiel.<br/> You lost 1032 soldiers.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: The Duke of Maree will be happy, but we could have done better!<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 12<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She wishes Crown funding for a project.<br/>Woman: Thank you for seeing me, Your Royal Highness. I... I come to you on behalf of the people.<br/>Woman: I wish to build a hospital where any citizen afflicted with disease can be brought for treatment.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Putting all the sick people together? Wouldn't that make them die even faster?)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 13<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the morning.)<br/>(Studied World History in the afternoon.)<br/> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A woman has been convicted of attempted murder and requests the mercy of the Crown.<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: Your Highness! This slattern dares to beg pardon, when she <b>admits</b> that she tried to poison my sister under her own roof!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Which sister?<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: Corisande, the Duchess of Mead.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (His other full-sister is the wife of the Duke of Kigal, and his mother is the Duchess of Lillah. Family ties are complicated.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is she all right?<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: She is unharmed. We caught the culprit in the kitchens before anyone could eat her foul spew.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?<br/>Condemned Woman: It's justice, it is! Them devils killed me brother, and broke me mam's heart.<br/>Condemned Woman: Lied to her, they did, when she went to see why he'd not come back. Said he'd gone for a soldier, when he never would!<br/>Condemned Woman: He weren't the only one neither. I waited ten years for my chance to get my own back. That's justice!<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: You see? She's completely unrepentant! Hang her and be done with it.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know what this is all about. Either way, murder is a serious crime, but...)<br/>Menu: [Put her to work] [Imprison her] [Execute her] <br/>Player chose: Put her to work<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This woman failed in her goals. She harmed no one. I do not require her life.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: If she is kept far away from your sister's court, she will no longer be a threat.<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: You're going to <b>forgive</b> her?!?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm indenturing her, not pardoning her. She will serve as a heavy laborer in northern Ursul.<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: She should be made an example of! She should be drawn and quartered in a public square!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I have spoken!<br/>Condemned Woman: Gods bless you, miss!<br/> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br/>(Put on the history outfit.)<br/><hr/>Week 14<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/> As you are walking one day in the gardens, you hear a strange sound and look up to see an owl flying overhead. A single dry leaf flutters in its talons.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's funny, I thought owls were nocturnal. I guess I was wrong.)<br/> When you return to the castle, your father is waiting for you.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/> A walk in the fresh air helps you forget the burdens on your shoulders.<br/><hr/>Week 15<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Flattery in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember that the Festival of the Good Lady is approaching.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There will be public celebrations for the commoners, followed by a grand gala for the nobility.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A grand ball... There will be dancing.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you would be expected to lead the procession and take part in the ceremonial planting, possibly give a speech.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: However, since you are not yet crowned, it is not required, and it may not be safe to expose you to the public.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, not safe?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Outside of the castle, you are less well protected. If anyone means you harm... Think on it now, decide later.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a letter for you as well.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's from Briony! I went to school with her, but she's a couple years older than me. Her mother is the Duchess of Mead.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's complaining that her mother still won't let her come home for the holidays.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Apparently her uncle Kevan is absolutely furious about that woman's trial.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's bored and looking for an adventure. Well, I don't have any to suggest to her!)<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 16<br/><br/>(Studied Flexibility in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Today is the procession and planting for the Festival of the Good Lady. Will you be leading the parade?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If you have any concerns about your safety, please, stay here.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The people will recover from disappointment; if we lose you, there is no recovery.<br/>Menu: [I will lead the parade] [I will parade and make a speech] [I would rather not go] <br/>Player chose: I will parade and make a speech<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm not afraid. I'm going to be the best parade-leader ever!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: My little girl.<br/> You prepare your best gown for the occasion, then walk slowly through the town with your attendants. It would not be appropriate for you to wear a sword, but you do walk with a sturdy golden scepter that's taller than you are.<br/> At the end of the route, you help the priestesses turn over the earth for the new tree to be planted.<br/> After the blessings are read, you hold up your hands and call for silence so that you can speak.<br/> Unfortunately, all the words you had planned go out of your head when you're faced with the moment.<br/> You manage a few polite sayings about the meaning of the holidays and thank everyone for attending, then turn away, your cheeks red.<br/> The procession regroups to return to the castle.<br/> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 17<br/><br/>(Studied Flexibility in the morning.)<br/> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Are you ready for the grand ball?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All the nobles in the domain are here to see you - to see their queen.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (gulp!)<br/> You finish dressing and descend the stairs to make a grand entrance.<br/> All around, the rich and powerful pause in their activities to gaze upon you, the ruler of them all.<br/> Seeing yourself reflected in so many eyes makes you want to run away and hide.<br/> After a moment, you force yourself to carry on, but you're sure they've all seen you hesitate.<br/> Your father waits for you at the bottom of the stairs and offers you his arm.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The first dance is for us.<br/> He guides you gently around the dance floor, never rushing you. It's fun to dance with your father, but the look in his eyes is so sad.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: After this, you must choose your own partner. There are a number of men who hope to catch your eye.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke of Kigal alone has brought three eligible sons, all near your age.<br/> You look around the room at all your possible partners - which is to say, everyone. No one may begin dancing until you do. You can pick whomever you want and you will not be denied.<br/>Menu: [Someone about your age] [Someone younger than you] [Someone older than you] [Someone already married] [Someone scandalous] <br/>Player chose: Someone older than you<br/> You look around for a likely candidate, and your eye settles on Chaine, the Earl of Mima. He's almost ten years older than you are and quite good-looking, so why not enjoy yourself?<br/> He smiles brightly at your approach and you begin to dance.<br/> Dancing with a real partner feels quite different from dancing with your father. You knew him, knew his steps like a part of you. Now every move is a mystery.<br/> Unfortunately, you lose track of which steps you're supposed to do when, and trip over your own feet. Oops!<br/> Between the dances, there is time for the guests to mingle, chat, and sample tiny bites of exquisite food.<br/> During a lull in the music, Banion, the duke of Maree, taps an elegant fingernail against a wineglass, letting the clear note ring out through the room.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might have your attention?<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I believe we should offer our compliments to our lovely hostess.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Her bravery and courage keep our borders defended.<br/> Everyone applauds politely.<br/> As the gala continues, you take the opportunity to observe nobles that you rarely see.<br/> There's Gwenelle, for instance - the Young Lady of Sudbury, only months older than you and due to finally inherit control of her duchy soon.<br/> Or Adele, the youngest daughter of the Duchess of Lillah and a fierce sportswoman. She was a few years ahead of you at school and the absolute terror of the ballfields.<br/> No Briony - she had said her parents were leaving her stuck at school this season.<br/> Her parents are here, dancing together - the Duke-Consort clutching his Duchess possessively tight.<br/> Strange that there's no sign of your cousins, though. Shouldn't they be here?<br/> Your aunt and uncle <i>are</i> here, of course. It would be scandalous if they hadn't come, Merva being so close by.<br/> It's nice to be able to enjoy time with friends and family, isn't it?<br/> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br/>(Put on the agility outfit.)<br/><hr/>Week 18<br/><br/>(Studied Trade in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br/> You wander downstairs to visit your father and talk about the latest events in the domain.<br/> You're moving with such enthusiasm that you don't realise your father isn't alone until it's too late to avoid him and his... companion.<br/>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: You are too kind, Joslyn.<br/> Countess Sirin. <i>Not</i> a member of your circles - she's a bit more than a decade your senior, far too old to have ever been your friend. And yet, not at all old, as noblewomen go.<br/> She has two minor titles, no husband, and <i>your father's arm in her grasp.</i><br/> How <i>dare</i> she make a move on your father?<br/>Menu: [Shame her with silent scorn] [Insult her with false flattery] [Trip her as she passes] <br/>Player chose: Insult her with false flattery<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Good afternoon, Countess.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: My, what large breasts you have. Putting them on display for any particular reason?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Elodie!<br/>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Really, my dear, it's not polite to comment on a lady's attributes like that.<br/>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: But you are young. You will... grow.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Ooo!<br/>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Perhaps we'll be seeing more of each other in the future.<br/> She gives a little wave and exits.<br/> Once she's gone, you raise an eyebrow at your father.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Don't give me that look, young lady. She's a nice woman, nothing more.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wants something more!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: And it's not going to happen any time soon.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You should be careful how you deal with people like Sirin. You need the goodwill of your nobles as well as your commoners.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: There haven't been any problems so far.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Many dark looks were aimed your way at the gala.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you must be aware of everything around you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Isn't that what I have agents for?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Yes, but you must give them direction. What is your greatest concern?<br/>Menu: [Noble plots] [Commoner uprisings] [Foreign threats] [Assassins] <br/>Player chose: Noble plots<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I need to know what the other nobles are up to, and whether anyone is plotting behind my back.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun.

Maybe I should leave them alone.)<br/>Menu: [Raise taxes] [Keep them the same] [Lower taxes] <br/>Player chose: Keep them the same<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I think they're fine as they are.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun.

<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A man has been convicted of the murder-by-strangling of his wife.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He does not deny the act, but requests a pardon that he might be set free.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: If you admit you killed your wife, why do you think I'm going to set you free?<br/>Condemned Man: Save me, Your Majesty! Wasn't my fault. <i>Demons</i> made me do it.<br/>Condemned Man: Everyone knows the power of magical beasties! They used me, they twisted my fingers into chains...<br/>Condemned Man: My wife found me screaming, she tried to shake me, and the chains wrapped around her...<br/>Condemned Man: I need the priestesses to bless me and make me clean again!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Demons that make you attack people? Is that even possible?)<br/>Menu: [Pardon him] [Imprison him] [Execute him] <br/>Player chose: Imprison him<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Whether there were demons or not, you still killed a woman - your <i>wife.</i><br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I won't forgive you for that. You will be imprisoned for the rest of your life.<br/> He opens his mouth to argue with you further, but then his shoulders slump.<br/>Condemned Man: Yes, Your Majesty.<br/> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br/>(Put on the intrigue outfit.)<br/><hr/>Week 21<br/><br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br/> You receive word that the murderer you condemned to prison has escaped.

Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 22<br/><br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Strategy in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I regret to inform you that Fabian, the Earl of Titan and Duke-Regent of Elath, has passed away.<br/> This isn't really a surprise; he was pretty old. The problem is the political implications.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: With the control of Elath in doubt, it falls to the crown to make decisions.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Young Lord Adair will not reach his fifteenth birthday for over two years. He requires a regent.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: His stepmother, Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, has petitioned that the boy be left in her care.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This would, however, leave her in personal control of two neighboring duchies, which is generally forbidden.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Not to mention that she's closely related to the Duchess of Mead and the Duke of Kigal!)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She could control almost the entire eastern half of Nova. People already call her Nova's other queen!)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Duchess Arisse almost certainly killed her second husband after she divorced him.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Her son, the Earl of Io, apparently hates and fears her.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (But without proof, she couldn't be punished.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The boy does have a living grandfather, the Earl of Ishtar. Or you might appoint an unrelated noble to act in his stead.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Earl of Ishtar has suggested another possibility. You and Adair are both young, not too far apart in age.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He requests that we accept the boy as your future husband and keep him here at the castle.<br/>Menu: [Leave him with Arisse] [Send him to his grandfather] [Marry him] [Send him to your uncle] <br/>Player chose: Send him to your uncle<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What about your brother Armand? He would be a safe pair of hands to watch over Adair.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br/> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br/><hr/>Week 23<br/><br/>(Studied Ciphering in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She is a musician and wishes Crown patronage.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Which means money.)<br/>Sabine: Your Royal Highness! If you accept me as a member of your court I will immortalise you in word and song.<br/>Sabine: I have dabbled in musical styles from many countries, and can entertain your guests and lighten your evenings.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Musicians are often used as secret agents and messengers. They can be useful - and dangerous.)<br/> The musician sings a little ditty to demonstrate her skills with the lute.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's actually pretty good.)<br/>Menu: [Accept her as Court Musician] [Reject her] <br/>Player chose: Accept her as Court Musician<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Very well, you can remain as part of the court.<br/>Sabine: I will do my best for you!<br/> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge.

He says the trees look different, and there are a lot more frogs. He looks forward to visiting the lookout fort at Shepherd's Point.<br/> You also receive an update from your agents. It would seem that the Duchess of Lillah is not pleased with your actions and is putting out feelers amongst the other nobles for support.<br/> If she means to rebel against you, that is treason. Unfortunately, she's a long way away, in her own power base. Calling her to order may not be easy.<br/> Still, the longer you wait, the more dangerous she may become.<br/>Menu: [Send soldiers to arrest her] [Send assassins to kill her] [Wait for more information] <br/>Player chose: Send assassins to kill her<br/> You give orders for assassins to arrange for a quiet and natural-looking demise. She is not a young woman, and she's just lost her husband... it shouldn't be suspicious.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 25<br/><br/>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br/> Staring up into the sky out your window, you notice a strange flash of light.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A falling star... Pretty!)<br/> You receive word that the Duchess of Lillah has passed away quietly in her sleep.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (At least, that's what everyone thinks!)<br/> She left her title not to the Earl of Io, but to Kiran, one of her younger sons. He's 19, and rather handsome as you recall. Everything has turned out for the best.<br/> A walk in the fresh air helps you forget the burdens on your shoulders.<br/><hr/>Week 26<br/><br/>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Naval Strategy in the afternoon.)<br/>Alice: My lady, there is a letter for you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Who sent this? It isn't signed...)<br/> It appears to be a poem, describing you in a manner that is entirely inappropriate for a Queen.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I *what*? With a *squid*?)<br/>Menu: [That's hilarious!] [That's terrible!] <br/>Player chose: That's hilarious!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's actually pretty funny!)<br/> Just then, an incredibly unlucky breeze swirls between the windows of your tower bedroom, tugging the paper out of your hands and off into the sky.<br/> You stick your head out the window to discover the 'poem' caught and fluttering on the roof nearby. You can <i>almost</i> reach it.<br/>Menu: [Climb out and grab it] [Ignore it] <br/>Player chose: Climb out and grab it<br/> You take a moment to look at where you'll have to climb in order to reach your target.<br/> It's so close! You just need to put your foot here, and your hand there, and then reach a little bit more...<br/> ...<br/> ... <b>OW!</b><br/> You're lucky you didn't break your neck, but your bruises are going to make it difficult to do anything strenuous for a while.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun.

Why does she keep writing me? We were never even friends.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She says she's bored and lonely and she's looking forward to seeing me at Gwenelle's birthday party.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's right! Gwenelle is about to turn fifteen! She'll be Duchess of Sudbury for real now.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (This other letter must be my invitation to her birthday celebration next week.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Gwenelle and I were friends at school, and this will be a big event, but it's also a long way to travel.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A lot of things can happen on the road.)<br/>Menu: [Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party] [Send your regrets] <br/>Player chose: Send your regrets<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I'd better stay here.)<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 28<br/><br/>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Naval Strategy in the afternoon.)<br/> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: *sigh*<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (All of my friends are at Gwenelle's party and I don't get to go.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I sent Gwenelle a letter saying that I couldn't come, but it was her mother the Countess who replied.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I think she's insulted that I didn't consider the event important enough to attend.)<br/> You take to the court for a few games of tennis.

It's well done, and clearly required hours and hours of needlework, but it's also fairly useless.<br/> Or is it? You did, after all, have his mother killed. Does he know? Is this cushion meant to send some sort of message? Or is it somehow trapped? Is it a <i>poisoned pillow?</i><br/> You place it across the room from you, far away from your bed, so you can keep an eye on it. Tomorrow you'll have it quietly destroyed, but for tonight, you won't be sleeping well.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.

I'm sorry to trouble you, but - have you seen Briony?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: No, not since I left school.<br/> She shakes her head.<br/>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: She's gone missing. She's not at school where she should be. I know she was unhappy, but I never expected...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wrote me a letter saying that she was bored and looking for adventure, but that's all I know.<br/>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: Oh, dear.<br/>Corisande, Duchess of Mead: I hope she hasn't done anything too foolish. My poor little lamb... I have to go look for her.<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: So. Your efforts to access the treasury have not been successful.

We need something cheerful.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You could hold a tournament.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What a good idea!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Knights, jousting, musicians... all sorts of competitions.

I will draft the announcements.<br/> You leave him to his work.<br/> As you move through the hall, your eye falls upon a vase of flowers. Pretty, but apparently not getting enough water. The leaves on one blossom have shriveled.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A leaf killed by a secret weakness... A hidden threat.)<br/> You continue up the stairs to your room, where a maid is waiting for you.<br/>Alice: My lady, a gift has arrived from Kigal.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: From the Duke?<br/>Alice: No, my lady. A merchant house, I believe. It was sent with a shipment down the Cavalla River.<br/> You tear open the brightly colored paper, to find:<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Chocolates!<br/> There is a little card with the box - 'With Our Compliments, The House of Kraellat'.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (There's something suspicious about this.)<br/>Menu: [Eat candy now] [Save it for later] [Test for poison] <br/>Player chose: Test for poison<br/> You can't think of any safe way to test the chocolate, and you don't want to leave it lying around where it might present a danger to others.<br/> Eventually you mash the candies together into an unappetising paste and bury the box in the palace garden.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's a waste, if they weren't really poisoned...

Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 36<br/><br/>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br/> The invasion of Nova is proceeding. Your coastline is under Shanjian control. Soldiers have marched through villages, trampling fields and frightening citizens.<br/> A diplomatic delegation from Shanjia has requested access to the castle to discuss terms - most likely, for your surrender. You lack the strength to hold off their armies, and surrendering now will save many lives. It would seem that you have no choice.<br/> You prepare yourself as best you can to meet with the representatives from Shanjia.<br/> You expected diplomats and a military representative, a general or an admiral. You did not expect the handsome man decked in jewels who now stands before you - a man announced by your servants as Togami, King of Shanjia.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is he really their King? Why would a king come all the way here?)<br/>Togami: My dear young lady. How difficult this must be for you. So much responsibility at such a tender age.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Don't pretend to be my friend while you're killing my people!<br/>Togami: Temper, temper, Princess. After all, I am here to <i>save</i> your people.<br/>Togami: War benefits no one, don't you think? Such a terrible waste. Better to settle things in a civilised manner.<br/>Togami: A contest. A game, so to speak, with Nova as the stakes.<br/>Togami: Should I win, then your domain will submit and accept me as Overlord with no further resistance.<br/>Togami: Should I lose, then my army will leave your domain in peace and shed no more blood.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What sort of game?<br/>Togami: It is well known that Nova is ruled by Lumens. As it happens, I too possess the powers of a Lumen.<br/>Togami: I propose a formal duel. My powers against yours. The winner takes control of Nova, the loser... dies.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: But I'm not a Lumen!<br/>Togami: Saving it for the coronation, were you? Such a pity that you'll be unprepared.<br/>Togami: Well, then. Go and find your crystal. Becoming a Lumen is a very simple matter. Then we can have our duel.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's the point? You know I can't win. Why don't you just kill me now?<br/>Togami: Because that's not the game. You want to save your people, don't you? I want to fight a Lumen.<br/>Togami: If you refuse, then the war will continue.<br/>Togami: I'll sweeten the deal. If you meet me in a formal Lumen challenge, I'll call off the invasion even if I win.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Really?<br/>Togami: I swear it by the gods. Nova will be free and safe.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Why take that risk? You're winning the war.<br/>Togami: It's not your land that I want. It's your crystal.<br/>Togami: To gain your power, I am willing to wager my own. Shall we begin?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't like this... But what choice do I have?)<br/>Menu: [Accept his terms] [Offer marriage alliance] <br/>Player chose: Offer marriage alliance<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What if I marry you instead? Then everything I have is yours as well!<br/>Togami: Silly little girl. I already told you.

I must.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No! Not my little girl!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You want to fight the Lumen ruler of Nova?<br/> Your father reaches into his pocket and pulls out a shimmering blue crystal, which he places over his heart.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: <i>Illuminate!</i><br/> Your hair stands on end as a veil of blue sparkles settles over your father, crawling into his skin. When it's over, the jewel has been absorbed into his body without a trace.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Fight me. Leave her alone.<br/>Togami: Well! This is not what I expected, but it will serve my purposes just as well.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Daddy?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Be quiet, Elodie. You are <i>not</i> a Queen yet.<br/> You are forced to sit and watch as the two men work out the details of the duel and its stakes, then take their places in a carefully warded circle.<br/> Your father crosses his arms, summoning up a thick gray fog that swirls around him, hiding him from view. But the Shanjian king conjures a cloud of glowing butterflies which drive into the fog and blow it apart.<br/> Then the invader claps his hands together and chants. Fiery red lights cluster over his fingertips and merge together into a pulsing blob before erupting towards your father. He resists with a beam of blue, catching the infernal energy and pushing it back in Togami's direction.<br/> You knew what the outcome would be, you knew it all along. Togami is a trained Lumen eager to demonstrate his powers, and your father...<br/> ... was your father.<br/> The blue crystal reappears, lying beside your father's body like an innocently-discarded bauble - but now that blue color is colored by a faint wash of red.<br/> The smirking King of Shanjia sweeps the crystal off the floor and tucks it away into his robes.<br/>Togami: How fitting. First I end your mother's life and then your father's.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You what?<br/>Togami: You didn't think her death was an accident, did you? That took careful planning!<br/>Togami: And now the Novan power is mine, and you even get to live.<br/> He holds out a hand in front of him, the elegant robe dangling freely.<br/>Togami: Now kneel and kiss my hand.<br/> Never. Not in a thousand years.<br/> With a scream, you launch yourself at the Shanjian king, prepared to go down fighting.<br/> Of course, it takes only a touch of his magic to end your life.<br/>Elodie did not survive to reach her coronation.  Nova would have to go on without her.</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!</p>
