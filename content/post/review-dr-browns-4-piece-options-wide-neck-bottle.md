The following is a review of Dr. Brown's 4 Piece Options Wide Neck Bottle, 9 Ounce, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Has Become Our Favorite Bottle
Quite simply, [Dr. Brown's 9 ounce 4 Piece Options Wide Neck Bottles][review] have become our favorite bottle for our now child.

Before having our child we received a number of Tommee Tippee bottles, and some Avent bottles. While we started with those, once we tried out the Dr. Brown's bottles our son seemed to take to them better, and I personally can't go back to any of the others.

The green pieces on the inside do seem to help with the amount of gas he has after taking a bottle, even after he started taking down more milk/formula, at a faster speed. I have forgotten to put the pieces in, however I haven't noticed the issues some other reviewers have with bottle leakage, and definitely not when the green pieces are in.

At first we were wondering about the size of the bottle, but for our average size baby, we started using it at two months with about 2 oz feedings with no issue.

Ultimately, we've discovered that all babies are different, but for our son we're going to stick with [Dr. Brown's 9 ounce 4 Piece Options Wide Neck Bottles][review] as long as we can, and have already purchased the next step of nipples once he progresses to that point. In our household, a full five of five stars, as we've had zero issues with them.
