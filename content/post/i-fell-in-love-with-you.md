<ul>
	<li>I fell in love with you,</li>
	<li>but you didn&#39;t know.</li>
	<li>I thought every night of you,</li>
	<li>but every night you slept well.</li>
	<li>I cried when I put my mind on you,</li>
	<li>but every day it got a little better.</li>
	<li>I listen to the bands and see you,</li>
	<li>but more and more you fade.</li>
	<li>I think I was in love with you,</li>
	<li>but were you a passing phase...</li>
	<li>I thought there was more to you,</li>
	<li>but one can never really tell.</li>
	<li>I guess that&#39;s it with me and you,</li>
	<li>but does that ever really go away?</li>
</ul>
