Description: Transcript of the movie <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304493681?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=6304493681" target="_blank">Ghost in the Shell</a> (1995) based upon a viewing of the English DVD release, using the English subtitles.

<p>
I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. 
</p>
<p>
The first version will be based almost exclusively on a subtitle rip. As I&#39;m able, I&#39;ll review the subtitles and supplement the transcript as possible.

For the sake of version control and in the interest of not having multiple versions floating about the Internet, please <strong>link</strong> to the pages on this site instead of copying the script elsewhere. Using short blurbs of a sentence or two is perfectly fine. Thank you :)

If you notice any problems with the movie&rsquo;s transcript, please just let me know. Also, if you have any comments or thoughts that you&rsquo;d like to share on a particular portion of the movie (or the movie in general), please don&rsquo;t hesitate to share them with the public via the comment system, or send them privately to <strong>strivinglife [at] gmail [dot] com</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
Obviously, I didn&rsquo;t write the original script, and I respect all copyrights as applicable. I&rsquo;m just a fan of the philosophy of the movie. I just hope others find it a valuable resource, and a stepping stone towards further discussions on this movie.
