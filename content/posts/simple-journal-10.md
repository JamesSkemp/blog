<p>Version 1.0 of Simple Journal is now available for download.</p>
<p>Simple Journal is meant to be exactly that; a <em>very</em> simple way to keep track of a journal.</p>
<p>Simple Journal uses XML files to store entries, which are edited in HTML (uses TinyMCE for the WYSIWYG editor) and which allow supplementation and later updates.</p>
<p><a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/SimpleJournal_1.0.zip">Download Simple Journal 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>To use Simple Journal extract the contents of the zip file to a directory and start _startCassini.bat. You'll see a dummy start page, with a link to the administrative area.</p>
<p>Click on Create new journal to create a new journal. The journal will be saved, by default, in the root of the install directory. Entries can be added using the appropriate administrative page.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>By default there is <em>no security on the administrative pages</em>. Unless you want <em>anyone</em> to be able to edit entries, <strong>DO NOT</strong> push the Admin directory to a publically available Web site. This application is meant to run on an individual computer or USB drive. However, there's nothing to stop you from publishing the individual XML files and the XSL file (keeping these in the same directory).</p>
</div>
<p>You'll need <a rel="external" href="http://smallestdotnet.com/">the current version of the .NET Framework</a> to run this application. No other requirements should be necessary.</p>
<p>Questions and comments welcome and appreciated.</p>
