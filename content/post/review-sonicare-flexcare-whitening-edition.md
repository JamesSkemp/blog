## Should Have Included Colored Bands
This is a quick review of the [Philips Sonicare FlexCare Whitening Edition][review] bundle.

I purchased this a couple of months ago since I've had great luck with Sonicare products in the past, but had disposed of mine when I moved in with my partner about a year ago. Since she expressed some interest in trying one, I picked up this bundle so we could each have one.

The toothbrushes themselves are great, and as are the nice charging/travel cases. I also really like that they include two different kinds of brushes so you can see which you like, and that both are full heads instead of small circular heads that used to be the norm on these.

What I don't like is that this is a two-pack but it doesn't include any of the bands that would normally be provided to help differentiate between the two. Initially we selected different heads to start with, which helped us tell the two apart, but now that we're using the same heads we no longer have that luxury.

In short, the only thing this bundle needs is those little bands to help tell the two brushes apart. Otherwise, this is a great bundle, and so far we're extremely happy with the [Philips Sonicare FlexCare Whitening Edition][review] bundle. Full five of five stars.
