<ul>
	<li>I would like to tell you that I love you, but I&#39;m afraid of the words...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m not worried about commitment, in the traditional sense...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m afraid that you&#39;ll hurt me, like all the ones before...</li>
	<li>How I would love to tell you that I want to make you happy, but should I...</li>
	<li>How I would love to tell you that I would do anything for you, my life is in your hands...</li>
	<li>But as I sit here, writing this piece...</li>
	<li>Tears come to my eyes, these tears are shed for you...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m not a poet, and I&#39;m not a politician...</li>
	<li>I can&#39;t say the words, that will knock you off your feet...</li>
	<li>But every time I see you, sitting that way that you do...</li>
	<li>Like a ray of light, drawing eyes towards you...</li>
	<li>Oh how I wish I could pluck my eyes out, my eyes water so...</li>
	<li>How I wish I had never met you, I wouldn&#39;t beat myself like I do...</li>
	<li>But oh to miss that radiance, that glow you&#39;ve gathered around you...</li>
	<li>I must wonder, could I be the one...</li>
	<li>I must wonder, do you think of me the way I think of you...</li>
	<li>How I wish I could read your mind, and find out what you think...</li>
	<li>I couldn&#39;t tell you how I feel, and then have you laugh or cry...</li>
	<li>I must wonder, is this just a passing phase...</li>
	<li>Will I see another, another as beautiful as you...</li>
	<li>Is this a crush, destined for pain and sorrow...</li>
	<li>Is this a chance, the only chance I have...</li>
	<li>You could be the one, but dare I take the chance...</li>
	<li>The stakes are high, so very high...</li>
	<li>On the climb up to this spot, my breathe kept getting shorter and shorter...</li>
	<li>My heart&#39;s pounding, I wonder if you can hear...</li>
	<li>Maybe you know, and you are just playing with me...</li>
	<li>Girls are like that, I&#39;ve known a few...</li>
	<li>They&#39;ve been hurt before, and retribution is their goal...</li>
	<li>I beat at my breast, just like in the old tales...</li>
	<li>I tear at my skin, pain to my flesh is nothing like painful thoughts...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m so sad, and I wish for peace...</li>
	<li>But I am a chicken, and a fool as well...</li>
	<li>&quot;I love you, I love you...</li>
	<li>&quot;Silly boy, no you don&#39;t&quot;...</li>
	<li>Jump off a cliff, fall to the ground...</li>
	<li>Is this more painful then, then getting hit by a car...</li>
	<li>I&#39;ve heard the silly love songs, and they&#39;re making me grim...</li>
	<li>Maybe I&#39;m too hasty, but it doesn&#39;t feel like I am...</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t feel wrong, I just feel bad/sad...</li>
	<li>&quot;Hey, I love you&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;Hey, I need you&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;Hey, can you show me the way&quot;...</li>
	<li>But, do I really need a reason to believe...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m at the end, it&#39;s tearing me up...</li>
	<li>I think, &quot;maybe it&#39;s possible&quot;...</li>
	<li>I once was going to ask, &quot;can I take you to a movie&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;Can I buy you a meal, and listen to you speak&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;I love how you talk, the way you talk&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;The words you use, the things you say&quot;...</li>
	<li>&quot;I&#39;ve enjoyed you since I met you, oh so long ago&quot;...</li>
	<li>But you&#39;ll never know, you&#39;ll never see...</li>
	<li>Someone will Google, and see these words I write...</li>
	<li>They&#39;ll come and read, perhaps...</li>
	<li>They&#39;ll say, oh how sweet...</li>
	<li>Or, oh how sad...</li>
	<li>And it is sad, I hope that is plain...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m torn, every cut is a woman...</li>
	<li>My heart is a mass, a pulp of veins...</li>
	<li>Some work, and some do not...</li>
	<li>Woman, oh how I curse them...</li>
	<li>But, how can I not love them!?!</li>
	<li>They&#39;ve made me flip, so I&#39;m quite insane...</li>
	<li>I wish I could be like the others, so they&#39;d find me pleasing...</li>
	<li>But I am not, I am a thinker...</li>
	<li>I love to listen, and hate to ignore...</li>
	<li>I&#39;m lost, and sinking fast...</li>
	<li>I keep hoping, &quot;next year&quot;...</li>
	<li>Next year comes, and I repeat my hope...</li>
	<li>I wish I was a jerk, a slob...</li>
	<li>They&#39;ve got the girls, but are any of them the one for me...</li>
	<li>There&#39;s many that I&#39;d love, with that grin that melts ice...</li>
	<li>With those eyes so sparkling, stars in a sky...</li>
	<li>Hair that moves, up and down and left to right...</li>
	<li>Skin so soft, and a smell that soaks the air...</li>
	<li>She has them all, those qualities I need to survive...</li>
	<li>Yet I cannot, no matter how much I would like...</li>
	<li>Oh, to tell her that I love her...</li>
</ul>
