<p>
For the last couple of days I&#39;ve tried opening a Flash video within Google Chrome.
</p>
<p>
By doing so, I&#39;ve effectively killed not just Google Chrome, but also my OS while Chrome attempts to cope.
</p>
<p>
I noticed from the beginning that Chrome&#39;s task manager listed the Flash plug-in as a separate &#39;page,&#39; and thought it might cause issues, but this is pretty sad.
</p>
<p>
I already forced an upgrade once, and and upgrading from 0.2.149.29 to _.30 now, but the issue still remains.
</p>
<p>
(Related to that, why did Chrome move backwards? If I force an upgrade, I should still be able to browse.)
</p>
<p>
Off to see if Flash is up-to-date ...
