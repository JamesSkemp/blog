<p>
Two comments after watching the Today show this morning.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
1. Traffic jams in the air because of flying cars? Supposedly, traffic jams in the air is unheard of - a new idea.
</p>
<p>
False. One example: Fifth Element.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction (speculative fiction), just as it wrote on the flying car, has already foreseen traffic jams in the air.
</p>
<p>
2. Nature or nurture?
</p>
<p>
Wrong. Nature <em>and</em> nurture.
