[18 Laboratory Development]
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s absolutely silent. They must have sealed it off.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Ghost dubbing. In past animal experiments, scientists mass replicated inferior copies, but had to abandon the practice as it destroyed the original being.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But Locus Solus brainwashed girls supplied by the Kojinkai mob, dubbing their ghosts into gynoids. It was the ghost that made Locus Solus gynoids so desirable.&quot;<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
&quot;Help me ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou readies his gun.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Help me ...&quot;
</p>
<p>
(One of the girls is still alive and conscious.  It&#39;s the same girl from the photo in the inspector&#39;s house.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;You came to help me. Mr. Volkerson promised ... The police would come and rescue me. I was stage four, but my friend Soana, is already stage five. She can&#39;t hear anything and never answers anymore.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Volkerson, the murdered consignment inspector revised their ethics code. Exposed, the yakuza served him up to avenge the crime boss. But Volkerson was right.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;If the robots made trouble, someone would notice. Someone would come to save us.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Didn&#39;t he consider the victims? Not the humans. What about the dolls endowed with souls?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But ... but ... I didn&#39;t want to become a doll!&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;We weep for the bird&#39;s cry, but not for the blood of a fish. Blessed are those who have voice.&#39; If the dolls could speak,  no doubt they&#39;d scream, &#39;I didn&#39;t want to become human.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Let me ask you this, do you consider yourself happy?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;A nostalgic value, I suppose. At least I am free of qualms. &#39;Let one walk alone, committing no sin, with few wishes.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;&#39;Like an elephant in the forest.&#39;&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Always remember, Batou ... Whenever you enter the Net, I&#39;ll be by your side.
</p>
<p>
&quot;I&#39;m going.&quot;
