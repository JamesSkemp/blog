<p>
On July 7, of this year, I went to the farmer&#39;s market off of the Capitol square, in Madison. I picked up some sunflowers and a bunch of flowers. I ended up taking a number of pictures before the flowers eventually died, and the picture I used for the new header image is one of those taken.

The file size for the image is rather large, in my opinion, but with today&#39;s speeds, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. A lower quality one just didn&#39;t look as nice as I would have liked ...&nbsp;
