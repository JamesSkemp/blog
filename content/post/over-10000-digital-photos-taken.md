<p>Yesterday afternoon I took digital photo number 10,000.</p>
<p>Between the three digital cameras that I've owned (and excluding the one that I borrowed from my sister, which was&nbsp;a gift from her friend Char), I've taken the following.</p>
<p>From April 6 2005 to May 9 2007, I took 2924 photos with a Canon 300D (Digital Rebel).</p>
<p>From May 18 2007 to March 29 2008, I took 6447 photos with a Canon Digital Rebel XT (350D).</p>
<p>From February 2 2008 to March 29 2008, I took 776 photos with a Casio EX-Z1200.</p>
<p>They say that your first 10,000 photos are your worst, and since I was only able to pick out a little more than 600 that I thought would be good enough to <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/">sell</a>, I do hope that that's true.</p>
