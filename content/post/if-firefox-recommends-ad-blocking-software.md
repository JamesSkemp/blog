<p>
The other day I installed YSlow on my home machine.
</p>
<p>
When I did so I noticed that they were recommending the major ad blocking add-on, but I didn&#39;t think too much of it.
</p>
<p>
I was reading an article that&nbsp;questioned again (id est, old news)&nbsp;whether Chrome would strain the Google/Mozilla relationship.
</p>
<p>
Since the ad blocking add-on blocks Google ads, I wonder if instead of Chrome, it&#39;s these recommended add-ons that are causing the strain. If you were Google, would you want your ads blocked?
</p>
<p>
I checked a few moments ago and am not seeing the recommendation any longer, so I can&#39;t reproduce at the moment, but nonetheless ...
