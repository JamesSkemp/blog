<p>I purchased an HP Pavilion a6360t with Windows Vista Home&nbsp;Premium&nbsp;and later upgraded it (due to a conference) for free to Windows Vista Ultimate, and then added a second hard drive.</p>
<p>What would happen when I upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium? Could I use the 64-bit version?</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is, due to testing, below:</p>
<h3>Windows 7</h3>
<p>Upgrading, doing a custom/clean install on my primary drive required approximately 38 minutes. That's it. That's for about 170 GB of data on a 455 GB drive/partition.</p>
<p>A Windows.old directory <em>was</em> created and contains PerfLogs, Program Files, Users, and Windows directories, however since I backed everything up, I believe these can be safely removed.</p>
<h3>64-bit</h3>
<p>Running an Intel tool to verify, I was rather certain that I would be able to run a 64-bit operating system. And I can.</p>
<h3>Second hard drive</h3>
<p>The second hard drive was untouched. I did notice some weirdness when I was downloading Microsoft's AV solution, where a temporary directory was created on my secondary drive, but everything on the drive is still there, as I wanted.</p>
