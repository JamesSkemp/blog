  </header>
  <div class="body">I must admit that Robert Heilbroner&#39;s An Inquiry Into the Human Prospect was not quite the book that I thought it was going to be. The title and cover were what drew me to the book, and the back cover information had little impact, if any, because I realized after reading the book that I may not have read it... Of course, Heilbroner refers to Hobbes at least once, and Marx quite a few times, and since these two are political philosophers, and since philosophy runs through everything, I wasn&#39;t displeased with the book in the least.</div>

    <div class="title"><a href="http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/posts/On-the-Speed-Limit/">On the Speed Limit</a></div>
  </header>
  <div class="body"><p>
Let&#39;s assume, firstly, that you are driving in a 55 mile per hour (mph) zone. Now, that is the speed limit, or, in other words, the limitation of traffic/vehicle speed. Now, if you are going 55 mph, then you are going 100% of the allocated speed. That is, you are going 55 in a 55 zone.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you are going 50 mph, in that same 55 mph zone, then you are going 90.90% of the allocated speed (50 / 55). So, you are going ~ 9.1% under the speed limit (5 / 55). Now, if you are going 5 mph over the speed limit, or 60 mph, then you are going ~ 9.1% over the speed limit, or, 109% of the allocated speed limit (60 / 55). Now, 109% over the posted speed limit is not that bad.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us assume that you are going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. 65 / 55 is equal to 1.18, so, you are going 118% over the speed limit. Now, what about 7 mph over the speed limit (in a 55 mph zone)? Well, 62 mph translates to ~ 113% of the speed limit, or 13% over the speed limit.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us take that 7 mph and translate it to a few different speeds, which tend to be common road speeds (at least in Wisconsin), as well as what 5 mph over the speed limit would be, as well as 10 mph over. All percentages are rounded to the nearest percent (1%) in this and in later tables.

I do not think, however, that you clearly understood my main points about the goals, or end, of life. Please find here my thoughts regarding this. I look forward to your comments regarding this. As I said before, everything leads towards one goal, which &#39;results&#39; in the end of history. After all, the telos is final, and therefore leaves room for no other causes.</div>

See the complete script for Waking Life. There is more to this then the discussion about God. This is packed full with a lot of various things, all of which deserve some time. I&#39;ll start with this passage first. However, before I do that, I should point out that I&#39;m not sure whether or not these two are both film directors.</div>

  <div class="body">Note: Mainly, I will be quoting Skinner, interceding my own comments if/when necessary. This should not be taken as something which explains this particular chapter, rather as something which points out some of the things that I found to be important (and that I made notes regarding in the margins). Notes regarding mistyped statements would be greatly appreciated (since I had to type all of these quotes myself). Originally titled: B.F.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body"><p>
As with the 19th century figure Kierkegaard, one could quite easily ask whether the 19th century writer Nietzsche is a philosopher. After all, if we compare their writings to the writings of such 19th century philosophers as Hegel and Schopenhauer, we are confronted with quite a difference. Yet, basing our decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the format of their writings is, I believe, flawed. Rather, one should base their decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the <em>content</em> of the writings. For this paper, I will be doing exactly this: I will be looking at the content of Nietzsche&#39;s writings in order to show that he is doing philosophy, and is therefore a philosopher.

  </header>
  <div class="body">It&#39;s said that &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned,&quot; but is that really true? How can it be that by saving something you earn it? Doesn&#39;t the fact that you already have, in this case, a penny prohibit you from earning it, since we usually give something to someone and say they earned it...? After some thought regarding this topic I have come to find a possible answer to the question of what this saying means.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body"><p>
While the exact date of the foundation of Thebes, located 30 miles northwest of Athens in eastern Boeotia, has not been clearly established, ruins have been found dating back to 1300 B.C. (Wiseman, p.624). One of the reasons that so little is known about Thebes is that it doesn&#39;t play any major roles in history until the sixth century B.C. However, one myth concerning Thebes&#39; origin does exist that is important to mention due to its inclusion of known figures of Greek tragedy.
