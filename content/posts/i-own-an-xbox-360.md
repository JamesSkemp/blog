<p>
So I did it. 
</p>
<p>
Back on November 17 2007 <a href="/words/post/10-random-reasons-why-I-bought-a-Playstation-3.aspx">I purchased a Playstation 3</a>. I had debated, back and forth, the purchase of that versus the Xbox 360. 
</p>
<p>
At the time the Xbox was having quite a few issues, including overheating, power block malfunctions, and the wonderful RROD. 
</p>
<p>
However, as time has gone by, the number of complaints has gone down. Some say that the issues are basically resolved, and you just need to find newer systems. 
</p>
<p>
What I can tell you is I spent the $39.99 for the extended warranty from Best Buy, and I only purchased the Pro &#39;edition&#39; (while I really wanted the black one, I couldn&#39;t justify the extra $100). I realize that I&#39;ll probably have issues with it at some point, but the Playstation 3 just isn&#39;t pumping out the good games as fast as it can. 
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;m back to a state that I haven&#39;t been in since the N64 was still about; I&#39;m a two console man. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a couple of things that I don&#39;t know that I care for with the Xbox 360. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<div>
	Everything seems really large. There&#39;s a huge power brick, there&#39;s huge plugs. The controller seems excessive ... WTF? 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Batteries for the controller? Really? I&#39;m spoiled by my Playstation 3 in this regard; plug it into the machine using a standard USB cable to charge it and that&#39;s it. 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	The fan is loud. However, it runs pretty cool (to the touch, that is). 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Loud disc reads. Could be because it&#39;s vertical, but it just seems kind of loud. 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	30 minutes to start playing (on initial setup). I also kind of wanted to hold off on activating the Gold membership trial until this weekend, but, whatever, I guess it&#39;s okay. 
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Otherwise, I&#39;m pretty happy thus far. Still getting used to the controller, but ... a good purchase. 
</p>
<p>
I am glad I purchased my PS3 first, however. Besides, now when my system has to go in for repair I can still game. 
</p>
<p>
As before, I&#39;m still updating <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/video_games.xml">my XML file with my game purchases</a>. Although I&#39;ll probably work on moving it to an ASP.NET page eventually ...
