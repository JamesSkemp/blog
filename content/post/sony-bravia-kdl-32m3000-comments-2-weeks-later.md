<p>In the beginning of this month, <a href="/words/post/My-new-television-the-Sony-Bravia.aspx">I purchased a 32" Sony Bravia</a>. In the two weeks that I've had the television, I've run into a couple of things that I would like the television to offer. In no particular order, they are listed below.</p>
<h3>Better volume detection</h3>
<p>Maybe it's because the speakers are better on this tv than my old one, but there's definitely an issue with commercial versus programming volumes. Commercials are <em>way</em> louder than they need to be, compared to the show that I really want to watch. Since I'm watching more digital channels (via an antenna), this may be an issue with those channels. Nonetheless, it would be great to have the ability to set a volume level, and let the tv dynamically control the level outputted. I want to hear the same level of noise, no matter what I'm watching. Otherwise, I have to keep changing the volume during/after commercials.</p>
<h3>Better picture-in-picture</h3>
<p>From what I can tell, you can only have picture-in-picture if you're hooked into a PC. Why not let me put something else down there? Let me play a video game, have the sound off on that, and then listen to a tv show or dvd?</p>
<h3>Better input switching</h3>
<p>I bought some really nice component av cables for my Playstation 2, so I no longer have to use the standard av cables. However, I'm using av cables for my DVD player (or at least, I was until I decided to use the PS2 for my DVDs, finally; but that's another story). If I want to switch from TV to DVD to Playstation, I've got to move through a number of inactive components. Why not let me hide components that I'm not using, like I can do for channels? I can name my components, so it doesn't seem like this would be too difficult ...</p>
<h3>Better guide functionality</h3>
<p>The Bravia has a pretty good Guide, which allows you to move through all available channels to determine what's on where. However, unlike what you'd think, it's basically no different than switching the channel with display on. Why not let me stay what channel I'm on, and just get the information about what else is on, so I can keep watching what I am? (Added November 18, 2007.)</p>
