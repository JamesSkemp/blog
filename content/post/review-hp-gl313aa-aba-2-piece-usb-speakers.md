The following is a review&nbsp;for HP Multimedia Speakers, specifically <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VEAZ8M?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">HP GL313AA#ABA 2-piece USB Speakers</a>.

I don&#39;t play PC games any more, and I watch (most) movies on my nice television. So, what I really wanted from these little speakers was to be able to listen to iTunes every once in a while, and watch assorted videos online (YouTube, Video.Google, and even Netflix every once in a while). 
</p>
<p>
These speakers are perfect for exactly that. 
</p>
<p>
The small size means that they don&#39;t take up too much real-estate on my desk (about 3.5 inches wide and 3 inches deep), but they&#39;re nice enough that I can enjoy listening to music or videos. 
</p>
<p>
And, with USB, that means not having to worry about a lot of cords. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;ve been very happy with this purchase.
