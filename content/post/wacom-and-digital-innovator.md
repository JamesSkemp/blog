<p>
Some time ago, I purchased a Wacom Graphire (the larger 6 x 8 model) direct from Wacom (since the local shops either didn&#39;t carry or were sold out).  Since then, I&#39;ve completed two surveys and received two DVDs from the <a href="http://www.digitalinnovator.com/">Digital Innovator</a> series.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

On the one hand, the Digital Innovator series is a big plug for Wacom&#39;s digital pen solutions.  The users in the videos primarily use the Cintiq family of products which, quite frankly, are amazing.  Yet, at the same time, you&#39;re given pretty good tips on how to use the technology - both hard and soft - to both create something amazing, and do it quickly and easily.

For what the DVDs provide, $30 is a bit steep.  Yet, as an incentive, they&#39;re worth their weight in gold to Wacom.  Having used my Graphire tablet at home for the last number of months, I&#39;ve found it to extremely intuitive, and it seems as though my wrist has been hurting less because of it.

Unfortunately, a) I work with text so much that a mouse (something that I can easily set down, nudge, ...) has it&#39;s benefits and b) I only use it at home - I have a standard mouse at home.  Nonetheless, I would only trade my Graphire for one of Wacom&#39;s other products.
