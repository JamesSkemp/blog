<p>
This is the review that I wrote for Amazon.com for the book <cite>Counterfeit Worlds</cite> by Brian J. Robb.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
The book can be purchased online at Amazon.com: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840239689?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1840239689">Counterfeit Worlds: Philip K. Dick on Film</a>
</p>
<hr />
<p>
First off, I haven&#39;t read too many books on films based upon the works of PKD. I bought this book because I&#39;m a fan of Dick&#39;s works, and the films that are closely linked to it (A Scanner Darkly primarily, but before that film came out, Blade Runner - the rest, to me, are like Vanilla Sky, and the Matrix; movies &#39;using&#39; Dick&#39;s ideas).<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I found this to be a very good overview of not only the films that were based on PKD&#39;s works (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Confessions d&#39;un Barjo, Impostor, Minority Report, Paycheck, and A Scanner Darkly), but also his life (~32 pages), radio and TV adaptations, and upcoming/unmade projects (film and otherwise).
</p>
<p>
You should read this book if;
</p>
<p>
a) You&#39;re interested in reading about PKD&#39;s life,<br />
b) You&#39;re interested in reading about how some of his films ended up being made (those listed above),<br />
c) You&#39;re interested in reading about the influence that PKD&#39;s works had on the realm of film in general.
</p>
<p>
You shouldn&#39;t read this book if you want to find out more about the radio/tv programs based upon his works, since you won&#39;t get too much from this book on these (not that you necessarily should).
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re just interested in finding out more about Blade Runner, you&#39;d probably be safe purchasing this book for that reason alone.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s lots of pictures, the type is rather normal (small-ish, in a good way), and there&#39;s some new content in this book - not just the author&#39;s perspectives, but also new interviews, albeit only snippets from these - so you&#39;ll certainly get your money&#39;s worth.
</p>
<p>
4 stars because I didn&#39;t &#39;love it&#39; - I thought it was very good, and I may end up looking at particular parts over again (and it got me to dust off my copy of Impostor for another viewing), but there&#39;s no real reason to re-read the book, in my opinion.
