<p>Having created an <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/XML-Schema-Definition-creation-Journal-Part-1-Primary-layout.aspx">overview of how I wanted to craft a simple journal in XML</a>, I next created an <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/XML-Schema-Definition-creation-Journal-Part-2-XSD-file-with-oXygen-XML-Editor.aspx">XML Schema Definition for the simple journal</a> to validate against.</p>
<p>Having now crafted a Web&nbsp;application to create the XML files I'm able to move onto the prettier aspects of display for the XML files.</p>
<p>I've created a <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xml/samples/journal-200912.xml">sample simple journal</a> that uses an XSLT (XSL Transforms, or extensible stylesheet language transformations) to make the display a <em>little</em> prettier.</p>
<p>You're more than welcome to take <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xslt/SimpleJournal.xsl">the XSLT file</a> and craft it to your own purposes.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>I'm sure I'll tweak the output further as time goes by; this is purely meant to be a quick working version.</p>
</div>
<p>Suggestions or new transforms welcome and appreciated.</p>
