<p>For releases of iTunes Playlists to Xml I've just been creating new posts with details, but that doesn't make all that much sense.</p>
<p>So, I've created an actual project/product page for the application.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml.htm">View the project page for iTunes Playlists to Xml</a>.</p>
<p>Comments appreciated.</p>
