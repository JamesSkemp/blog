<p>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: We're almost home. Your room is just the way you left it.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: <em>sigh</em><br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br/> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br/>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br/>Player chose: I've played this before</p>

<p><hr/><p>Week 1</p></p>

<p>(Studied Novan History in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad? Can we talk?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I'm sorry. Your uncle and I have things to do. Maybe another time.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br/><hr/>Week 2<br/><br/>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br/>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br/>Player chose: Arrest her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are a traitor to the crown and I ought to have you executed.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: GUARDS! Arrest her!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Throw her into the castle dungeons and let her rot!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Well. I suppose she won't be a problem anymore.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 3<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Me too.<br/> You gather your skirts and prepare to sit down, when all of a sudden, a hissing noise alerts you to a hidden danger - a snake!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Charlotte, don't move!<br/> You grab for a stick to push the snake away, but you lack the skills to do the job properly, and poking the snake only makes it angry. Too fast to see, it lunges forward and sinks its fangs into your leg!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: OW!<br/> The snake slithers away, but it's too late now. A strange tingling sensation begins to spread through your flesh.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: That's a milk viper. They're poisonous!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't feel good.<br/> Your leg is going numb. You stumble and fall to the ground.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hold on!<br/> Your cousin kneels beside you and presses her hands over the bite mark. The area throbs painfully, then begins to feel warm.<br/> After a minute, you're dizzy, but your leg isn't buzzing anymore, and even the wound has disappeared.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: How did you do that?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I don't know how I do it. I just can.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I'm not supposed to tell anybody. People think it's freaky. You won't tell, will you?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Of course not. I'm just lucky you were here.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Girls? What's going on out here? I heard yelling.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Nothing!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We saw a snake, but it got away.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: A snake! That's it. Charlotte, pack your things. We're going back to Merva. It's not safe here.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Awww...<br/> You venture into the depths of the castle dungeons.<br/> The Duchess of Ursul is there, in her cell, sitting perfectly straight on the bench against the wall and looking your direction as if she'd been expecting you.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Caution is wise for one in your position. Hasty judgments can lead to trouble.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Are you ready to listen now?<br/>Menu: [Hear her out] [Taunt her] <br/>Player chose: Hear her out<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you want to say?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It is the responsibility of the king or queen of Nova to handle magical energies to protect the domain.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is what a Lumen does - what your mother did, and what I do.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father said it was your fault she died!<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: What he said was that she died by magic. Being a Lumen is never <i>safe.</i> We pay a high price for our powers.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: But without a Lumen queen, this entire domain is at risk.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Release me, and I will teach you what you need to know to keep your responsibilities.<br/>Menu: [Free her] [Refuse] <br/>Player chose: Refuse<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You don't tell me what to do. I'm the Queen!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You can starve in here for all I care.<br/><hr/>Week 4<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 5<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied World History in the afternoon.)<br/> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br/>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Sedna, that's in Talasse, the domain to our southeast.)<br/>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It might not be appropriate for me to wear a man's gift in public, though. People would think it meant something.<br/>Menu: [Wear it] [Don't wear it] <br/>Player chose: Don't wear it<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's important to maintain the proper image.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad? What really happened to Mom?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: She was a Lumen, a magic-user. It was meant to be in reserve, to defend our domain, but she insisted on...<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: ... you don't need to hear that.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: She used magic. It drained her strength. She thought it was harmless, and it wasn't. Eventually, her heart just... stopped.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: That's why I don't want you involved with it.<br/><hr/>Week 6<br/><br/>(Studied Public Speaking in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That woman, the priestess, keeps staring at me.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you want?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Your destiny will find you, even if you run from it. You were born to wield the power of a Lumen.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you know about that?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The power was your mother's, and the kings and queens before her. It is your right and your responsibility to defend your domain.<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I have seen signs of the future. Danger is coming. Without that power, this land is defenseless.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well... What am I supposed to do about it?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The Duchess of Ursul will teach you, if you set her free.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: But -<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: She never harmed your mother. They were friends. It is only because she bears the power of a Lumen so openly that your father rejects her.<br/>Menu: [I will free her] [I won't free her] <br/>Player chose: I won't free her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is all a trick to get the traitor released. I won't listen to you!<br/> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br/><hr/>Week 7<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Herbs in the afternoon.)<br/> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br/> You swiftly step aside and let her pass.<br/> You return to your rooms, but you have barely settled when someone knocks on the door.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A visiting noble wishes to speak with you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: <em>sigh</em> Who is it?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke Consort of Mead.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (If I remember right, he's the brother of the Duchess of Ursul.)<br/> You follow your father downstairs to greet your guest.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: Your Highness. Thank you for meeting with me in this difficult time.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: I come to you on behalf of the people of Ursul, who have been left without a protector.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: Commoners require governance and leadership, or they fall into chaos.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You want me to free your sister the Duchess?<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: I wish for Ursul to have a leader. If my sister has displeased you, then I stand willing to serve.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: If you prefer Julianna in that position, then yes, free her. It is, of course, your decision.<br/>Menu: [Free Duchess Julianna] [Give her title to Ignatius] <br/>Player chose: Give her title to Ignatius<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine, then. <b>You</b> can be Duke of Ursul.<br/>Ignatius, Duke of Ursul: On behalf of our people, I thank you for your wisdom.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Now I can leave Julianna locked up forever and no one will care!)<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 8<br/><br/>(Studied Instrument in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br/>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br/>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br/>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know much about factories or trade. Would that really be worthwhile?)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 9<br/><br/>(Studied Flattery in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the afternoon.)<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I know there's been some problems with Ixion, but I don't know the details. I guess they're occupying southern Maree.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything about the military. I don't want to fight.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might say so, you are looking particularly lovely this day. I hope you will think fondly of me.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is he flirting with me? He's almost as old as my father!)<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 10<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It was the Duchess of Hellas who tried to take over part of Ixion's territory, without the support of my mother the Queen.)<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br/>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br/>Player chose: Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We appreciate that you feel wronged. One of our subjects attempted to instigate a rebellion in your territory.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: However, she did not have our approval for these actions. If you withdraw your troops, we will punish her.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Your Highness!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is the fair solution. You have no right to invade us because of her actions.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: What manner of punishment were you considering?<br/>Menu: [Make her a commoner] [Command her to marry an Ixionite] [Execute her] <br/>Player chose: Execute her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: For her disobedience, she will be executed.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: <b>What?!?</b><br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, I must protest!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: No one crosses me and lives. Not Hellas and not Ixion. Remember that!<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Very well. We will accept this apology.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: You can't be serious!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Out!<br/> You go down to the dungeons to taunt Julianna with her helplessness and lack of noble status.<br/> However, when you approach her cell, you find her sitting cross-legged with her eyes closed, paying absolutely no attention to you.<br/>Menu: [Taunt her anyway] [Execute her] [Leave her alone.] <br/>Player chose: Taunt her anyway<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You're nobody, you know that? You're not a duchess anymore.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You're going to rot in here.<br/> She doesn't respond. From this distance, you can't be certain she's even breathing.<br/> Not that you're going to go into her cell to check. You're not that stupid.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine, ignore me! See if I care!<br/> You stomp off, determined not to waste your time. From now on you'll just avoid this cell.<br/><hr/>Week 11<br/><br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Lore in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 12<br/><br/>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She wishes Crown funding for a project.<br/>Woman: Thank you for seeing me, Your Royal Highness. I... I come to you on behalf of the people.<br/>Woman: I wish to build a hospital where any citizen afflicted with disease can be brought for treatment.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Putting all the sick people together? Wouldn't that make them die even faster?)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 13<br/><br/>(Studied Voice in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Lore in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A woman has been convicted of attempted murder and requests the mercy of the Crown.<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: Your Highness! This slattern dares to beg pardon, when she <b>admits</b> that she tried to poison my sister under her own roof!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Which sister?<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: Corisande, the Duchess of Mead.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is she all right?<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: She is unharmed. We caught the culprit in the kitchens before anyone could eat her foul spew.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?<br/>Condemned Woman: It's justice, it is! Them devils killed me brother, and broke me mam's heart.<br/>Condemned Woman: Lied to her, they did, when she went to see why he'd not come back. Said he'd gone for a soldier, when he never would!<br/>Condemned Woman: He weren't the only one neither. I waited ten years for my chance to get my own back. That's justice!<br/>Kevan, Earl of Io: You see? She's completely unrepentant! Hang her and be done with it.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know what this is all about. Either way, murder is a serious crime, but...)<br/>Menu: [Put her to work] [Imprison her] [Execute her] <br/>Player chose: Execute her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: As she is clearly guilty, her life is forfeit. She will be hanged in public as a deterrent to other criminals.<br/>Condemned Woman: Ye'll not have me!<br/> All of a sudden, she breaks loose from her guards and rushes at you!<br/> In your Court dress, you are unarmed - you grope for a weapon and find only a heavy golden ornament which you hurl in her direction.<br/> Your missile flies wide of its mark.<br/> Before you have a chance to do anything else, your personal guards step into action, cutting the woman down before she can endanger you. Her lifeless body lies bleeding on your carpet.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Get that out of here. Put it on display, so that everyone sees what happens to criminals.<br/> You sneak down to the castle dungeons and amuse yourself by poking the locked-up peasants with sticks. Poor fools.<br/><hr/>Week 14<br/><br/>(Studied World History in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br/> As you are walking one day in the gardens, you hear a strange sound and look up to see an owl flying overhead. A single dry leaf flutters in its talons.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's funny, I thought owls were nocturnal. I guess I was wrong.)<br/> You sneak down to the castle dungeons and amuse yourself by poking the locked-up peasants with sticks. Poor fools.<br/><hr/>Week 15<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Strategy in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember that the Festival of the Good Lady is approaching.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There will be public celebrations for the commoners, followed by a grand gala for the nobility.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A grand ball... There will be dancing.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you would be expected to lead the procession and take part in the ceremonial planting, possibly give a speech.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: However, since you are not yet crowned, it is not required, and it may not be safe to expose you to the public.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, not safe?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Outside of the castle, you are less well protected. If anyone means you harm... Think on it now, decide later.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a letter for you as well.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's from Briony! I went to school with her, but she's a couple years older than me. Her mother is the Duchess of Mead.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's complaining that her mother still won't let her come home for the holidays.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Apparently her uncle Kevan has been acting strangely lately and shouting at shadows.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Her parents are fighting and she thinks they might split up.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's bored and looking for an adventure. Well, I don't have any to suggest to her!)<br/> You sneak down to the castle dungeons and amuse yourself by poking the locked-up peasants with sticks. Poor fools.<br/><hr/>Week 16<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Today is the procession and planting for the Festival of the Good Lady. Will you be leading the parade?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If you have any concerns about your safety, please, stay here.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The people will recover from disappointment; if we lose you, there is no recovery.<br/>Menu: [I will lead the parade] [I will parade and make a speech] [I would rather not go] <br/>Player chose: I will lead the parade<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm not afraid. I'm going to be the best parade-leader ever!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: My little girl.<br/> You prepare your best gown for the occasion, then walk slowly through the town with your attendants. It would not be appropriate for you to wear a sword, but you do walk with a sturdy golden scepter that's taller than you are.<br/> At the end of the route, you help the priestesses turn over the earth for the new tree to be planted.<br/> Then the new life is blessed, and all the attendants join in song.<br/> The procession regroups to return to the castle.<br/> As you walk, all of a sudden, a man in black leaps out of the crowd, heading straight for you... and he's holding a sword!<br/> The last thing you see are his cold blue eyes staring into yours as his blade drives into your chest...<br/>Elodie did not survive to reach her coronation.  Nova would have to go on without her.</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!</p>
