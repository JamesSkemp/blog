<p>
No update in a while, so ...
</p>
<p>
1) If you say that Clinton&#39;s <cite>My Life</cite> has 1000 pages (pretty close to that), then I&#39;m 28.6% of the way through right now.&nbsp; I&#39;m about to shut off the computer and read for the rest of the night, which means that I may even be over 30% of the way (35%?) done by the night&#39;s end.
</p>
<p>
What this means is that I&#39;ll finally give Gavin a real idea of what I think about the book.&nbsp; Right now, I&#39;m still going towards good - the beginning was uncomfortable (the voice he used) but when he gets into politics it&#39;s quite good.&nbsp; I&#39;ve marked a number of passages that I&#39;ve found to be noteworthy, so if this continues, I might just bump it up to great.&nbsp; Both &#39;ratings&#39; assume that you like Clinton.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t, you might find his &lt;em&gt;experience X taught me to do Y when I was in Z office/president&lt;/em&gt; to be a bit much (?).
</p>
<p>
2) I won a date with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/hottygothgirl/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">hottygothgirl</a>, although I would have lost if Gavin would have shown for the second part (I only won the first part because I got the answers I didn&#39;t know from him).&nbsp; Unfortunately, that&#39;s another reason I have to get my butt up there (unfortunate because long distance trips have ended horribly for me this summer, and because it&#39;s going to be difficult with me moving both my mom and myself - luckily ...)
</p>
<p>
3) I should be able to move into my new place on the 1st, which isn&#39;t as early as I would have hoped, but is nonetheless two weeks earlier then I/we need to be out of our current place.
</p>
<p>
4) I picked up a copy of <cite>The Ghost in the Machine</cite> by Arthur Koestler.&nbsp; It&#39;s an out of print hardcover that I picked up for $10, plus .55&cent; tax.&nbsp; Wikipedia linked it to Ghost in the Shell as a reference, and there&#39;s a good deal of how it appears to argue a structuralism point of view.&nbsp; Since I&#39;m sick of the excessive Descartian notion being the fore-front philosophical perspective in movies, I figured it would be a good read.&nbsp; I&#39;m planning on doing with this book what I&#39;ve done partially with other books - do a chapter by chapter analysis.&nbsp; Since it&#39;s OP, since 1990, that either means that it&#39;s going to be reprinted soon or it won&#39;t be reprinted in a while.&nbsp; Either way, I should definitely take a careful look at this tome.
</p>
<p>
My sister actually found it in Paul&#39;s Books (off State St in Madison), so that was good.&nbsp; It was over in psychology, which makes sense reading the publishers perspective and the various cover texts (as in the text on the actual book&#39;s cover), but I initially thought philosophy.&nbsp; Ah well.

<p>
You&#39;ll note that if I was able to create a chapter by chapter look, I would be the only link on this page ...&nbsp; Hmm ...&nbsp; I still have to Google the necessary phrases to verify that this topic is indeed fairly rare (which would be great if it were).
</p>
<p>
Anywho, I&#39;ll be reading this starting right after I finish <cite>My Life</cite>. I&#39;ve been reading at a good clip, so if I limit my Internet usage, I should be able to start on Koestler before August (boy, would that be great).
</p>
<p>
5) I&#39;ve been quite sick these past couple of days.&nbsp; In about a day and a half I went through a box of Kleenex (sp?).&nbsp; Anywho, I think it&#39;s just a bad summer cold.&nbsp; I was almost at flu level yesterday, until I went to my mom&#39;s to sleep in A/C (or is it AC?).&nbsp; I&#39;m not over it yet, but, I&#39;m at least feeling better.&nbsp; Luckily I had asked off for today a number of weeks ago, just because.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I was planning on doing some cleaning/packing at my mom&#39;s.&nbsp; Ah well.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but at this point I&#39;m giving up and turning off the comp.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be using it limitedly over the next couple of days, as I&#39;ve got two eBay auctions I&#39;ve won / am probably going to win (one of each obviously - the one is sitting at about $2.50 and I&#39;ve got a max bid of a good deal about that - solid win for me, and I won&#39;t have to wait too long for it to ship if it stays below $11 total ($5 shipping which is what everyone charges for small items these days ...)).
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it, or all that&#39;s fit for print.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be checking on the LJs I check on, and then off goes the comp.
