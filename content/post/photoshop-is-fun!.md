Duh.

Unfortunately, much like Google Video, you can get sucked into the program and end up spending hours (2 and a half in my case) goofing around, getting nothing of real value done.  Of course, that begs the question of whether experience, as experience, is of any value.  Do we, simply by experiencing, benefit?  I suppose when it comes to use a technology, like Photoshop, any experience is a good experience.  (But what if you&#39;re using the tools incorrectly?)

I had my photo taken back in June 2006.  I finally downloaded them to my home computer and started goofing off.  Here&#39;s a before and after image.

I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad at all.  Photoshop CS2, with special thanks to my Wacom Graphire4.  I shudder to think how difficult this would have been with a simple mouse.  Now if only I could afford a <a href="http://www.wacom.com/lcdtablets/">Cintiq</a> ...

Closing note: thanks to Google for paying for a year&#39;s worth of hosting.  Thanks to AdSense, I received my first $100+ check a couple of days ago (which covered through August 31).  Normally, that would be almost $100 out of my own pocket, which I&#39;d just have to put up (since I&#39;m not leaving the Web for a long while), but G has successfully enabled me to keep writing, with only a cost of time.

Anywho, I&#39;ll have to take some of my own photos and see if I can play around with Photoshop a bit more ...
