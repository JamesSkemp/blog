<p>
There&#39;s a very cool interactive map for the University of Wisconsin Madison campus. You can see it at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.map.wisc.edu/">map.wisc.edu</a>.

In other news, hopefully I&#39;ll have some photos of my new car, a 2007 VW Rabbit that was built just for me.&nbsp; My previous car was a 1987 VW Golf, which makes my new car 20 years newer.&nbsp; Not too bad for my second car.

With just a little luck (not very much at all), the Rabbit should last 20 years as well.
