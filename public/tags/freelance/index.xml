      <description>&lt;p&gt;
For the past hour, I&amp;#39;ve been looking at current ways to get my name out there for Web page cleanup and commenting.  In other words, I&amp;#39;d like to work with existing code to bring it closer to the standards, and comment it, if necessary.  I would think it would be of great benefit to those individuals who bought a solution from a vendor, and are looking at changes to that code, or cleanup so that there pages act alike in most browsers.  Unfortunately, I haven&amp;#39;t found a site to offer my wares.  I&amp;#39;ve also looked at open source projects that may need some free help, but, alas, nothing there either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If someone happens upon this by way of a Google search (or any other search - Google just happens to bring in the most traffic for me), I&amp;#39;d be interested in hearing from you on whether you&amp;#39;re looking for something similar, or if you&amp;#39;re looking for someone to fill that position ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
