<h3>[5 Only a Puppet]</h3>
<p>
(A helicopter lands in a yeard. Police, and Aramaki, are standing outside that yard, in the trees.) 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll rush the place once the guys in the helicopter are inside. Squad B goes around back, the rest of you take the front. Saito, have your men pull the plugs on all their cars. 
</p>
<p>
Begin recording. 
</p>
<p>
Message from HQ, sir. 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve ID&#39;ed the guy the Major collared. 
</p>
<p>
Go on. 
</p>
<p>
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28. Illegal alien. Weapons violations. Three priors. Was hiding out with a militant refugee group up till a month ago. One week ago, because of his record he was contacted by a military liason in the Gavel embassy to attack the secret talks we would be having with them. 
</p>
<p>
And the real story? 
</p>
<p>
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation: a rather violent scrap dealer. Guess you could call him a thug. We&#39;ve checked the records the local cops have on him but we can&#39;t find any connection with Gavel. Another puppet from our friend the Puppet Master. 
</p>
<p>
And what about Ishikawa? 
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s back. He&#39;s with Togusa, talking to that poor trash man. 
</p>
<p>
So, what about the Puppet Master on your end? 
</p>
<p>
How&#39;s he look to you? 
</p>
<p>
Like a puppet himself... 
</p>
<p>
Squad B, in position. 
</p>
<p>
Squads A and C, ready! 
</p>
<p>
Ready to move in, sir. 
</p>
<p>
Move in. 
</p>
