The following is a review of Lance Gluten Free Cookie Sandwich, Peanut Butter, 5 oz, provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## The cookie just seems off

Over the last year I've been having some stomach issues, and while tests seem to have suggested I should be fine, I've been trying to introduce more gluten free items into my diet. So when I had the opportunity to try [Peanut Butter Lance Gluten Free Cookie Sandwiches][product] I decided to do so. So it's not my first gluten free food, but my experiences are pretty limited.

I'm not sure what it is about the cookies, but they just seem off. The peanut butter itself is a little bland, and the cookie doesn't have much flavor. Almost like the cookie is stale, and they put too much of some other ingredient in order to mask it.

Unfortunately I can't really say too much more about them. The cookies themselves are fairly small, and I personally didn't find them very filling, but I also didn't have much of an appetite for them, because of the taste, and found myself eating them just to eat them.

I'm not sure what else to give it, so I give [Peanut Butter Lance Gluten Free Cookie Sandwiches][product] a neutral 3 of 5 stars. I don't see myself eating these again, whether they're free or not.
