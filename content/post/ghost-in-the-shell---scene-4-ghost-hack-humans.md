<h3>[4 Ghost Hack Humans]</h3>
<p>
(A man is picking up trash, while another is at a phone.) 
</p>
<p>
Come on! 
</p>
<p>
All right! 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re already 40 seconds behind schedule! 
</p>
<p>
Gimme five more seconds. 
</p>
<p>
Of all the lousy luck... 
</p>
<p>
Hey, sorry. 
</p>
<p>
My last partner, the one they busted for working without a permit, was a better worker than you! You&#39;re actually trying to ghost-hack your own wife just to see what&#39;s on her mind? 
</p>
<p>
She doesn&#39;t have any time for me and now she wants a divorce. On top of that, my daughter, my only child thinks I&#39;m cheating on her mother! 
</p>
<p>
So how&#39;d you get your hands on cracking software? 
</p>
<p>
From some programmer. A really nice guy I met in a bar. I told him my wife&#39;s lawyer was keeping me from seeing her and he said he&#39;d help. Told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught. Smart guy, huh? 
</p>
<p>
(Another car cuts him off.) 
</p>
<p>
Asshole! Ya tryin&#39; to get yourself killed?! 
</p>
<p>
Looks like we aren&#39;t the only busy people out here. 
</p>
<p>
(We switch to the car.) 
</p>
<p>
(Batou:) Nobody here. 
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the point? Even if we trace the calls the guy&#39;s already gone by the time we get there. 
</p>
<p>
Vicious cycle, huh? 
</p>
<p>
Quit complaining! Kusanagi and Togusa are headed for the next expected hack point. You two look for something there. 
</p>
<p>
Look for what? 
</p>
<p>
Anything. 
</p>
<p>
Fuckin&#39; old coot. He tells US to snoop around?! 
</p>
<p>
Wait a sec! Damn, missed him. 
</p>
<p>
Hey, Pops. Did you see a garbage truck go by here? 
</p>
<p>
Who wants to know? 
</p>
<p>
Did you see it or not? 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but they were gone by the time I got my trash. One was using the phone, so I thought I had time-- 
</p>
<p>
(They get in their car and drive off.) 
</p>
<p>
Uh, can you take this to them? 
</p>
<p>
A garbage truck? Of course... They move every seven minutes. Control! Get me the trash collection routes for that sector! 
</p>
<p>
(We switch to a computerized view of the city, similar to what we saw in the first scene.) 
</p>
<p>
There are eight garbage trucks operating in the target area. Target is a type C collection truck, #79. 
</p>
<p>
Let me drive. Ishikawa, check out the drivers&#39; homes. Batou, you get to their next stop before they do! 
</p>
<p>
He may be in contact with someone else. Observe, but don&#39;t move in! 
</p>
<p>
Route data accessed. Hacking points traced and matched. Target now stopped at next point. Confirm access via HA-3. 
</p>
<p>
(The same man as before hangs up the phone.) 
</p>
<p>
Sorry, sorry. How about I do the trash and you make the call on the next stop? Okay? 
</p>
<p>
Leave me out of your little crime spree. 
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t believe this load of bullshit... 
</p>
<p>
Do you have kids? 
</p>
<p>
Do I look like I do? 
</p>
<p>
Then you couldn&#39;t understand. My daughter&#39;s my life. Take a look. Isn&#39;t she just a little angel? 
</p>
<p>
(He tries to show him a photo, but he doesn&#39;t look.) 
</p>
<p>
I hate looking at other peoples&#39; family albums. 
</p>
<p>
(The phone rings.) 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, truck 79. Oh, boss. What&#39;s up? The cops were checking our routes? You wanna know why? How should I know?! 
</p>
<p>
They spotted the hack! I gotta warn my friend! We&#39;re gonna have to skip our next stop! 
</p>
<p>
Target has deviated from route. Increasing speed to next point. 
</p>
<p>
(Batou:) Is he on to us? Didn&#39;t think he could see me. 
</p>
<p>
(Kusanagi:) My accessing the sanitation department network may have tipped him off. 
</p>
<p>
Shoulda used a back door. 
</p>
<p>
Too late. Go for the collar. 
</p>
<p>
You can drive now. 
</p>
<p>
(Togusa takes the wheel, and spots the garbage truck.) 
</p>
<p>
(We see a man with sunglasses at a phone, sliding a card under it.) 
</p>
<p>
(He hears something, looks and sees the garbage truck. Next it&#39;s zoomed in, looking like a television. He zooms in further to the trailing truck, with Togusa driving. He shoots up the garbage truck and blows apart Section 9&#39;s. Batou speeds in from behind, but he puts up the hood on his coat and disappears.) 
</p>
<p>
Jesus... He blew a perfectly good armored van to shit. 
</p>
<p>
He hosed us with high-velocity AP rounds! That car door&#39;s no cover! 
</p>
<p>
In a submachinegun? The guy must be nuts. 
</p>
<p>
(Batou sees him slipping by on his left, and opens fire.) 
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s using thermoptic camo, too?! 
</p>
<p>
Keep after him! I&#39;ll flank him from above! Togusa, if you&#39;re still alive, arrest those two garbage men. 
</p>
<p>
Roger. This job just never lets up, does it? 
</p>
<p>
Police! Everybody down! 
</p>
<p>
All finished? 
</p>
<p>
You all set? That&#39;s what you get when you overload the ammo rating. Frame&#39;s bent all to hell. The barrel&#39;s shot, too. 
</p>
<p>
Doesn&#39;t matter if you arrest me. I&#39;m not gonna talk! 
</p>
<p>
Talk?! And what would I ask a guy who doesn&#39;t even know his own name?! 
</p>
<p>
Your mother&#39;s face. The place you grew up in. Memories of your childhood. Can you remember any of those things? 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s nothing sadder than a puppet without a ghost. Especially the kind with red blood running through them.
