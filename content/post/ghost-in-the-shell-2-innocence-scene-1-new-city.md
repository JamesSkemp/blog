<p>
In a future time, when most human thought has been accelerated by artificial intelligence and external memory can be shared on a universal matrix, Batou, an agent of the elite Section 9 Security Force and a begin so artificially modified as to be essentially cyborg, is assigned, along with his mostly human partner, Togusa, to investigage a series of gruesome murders.
</p>
<p>
Time has passed since Batou&#39;s original partner, Major Motoko Kusanagi, cybernetically enhanced to such a degree that only her &quot;ghost&quot; remained human, disappeared into the Net. Since then, Batou has wondered where her ghost might be and if the Major will ever return ...

If our gods and our hopes are nothing but scientific phenomena, then it must be said that our love is scientific as well - &quot;L&#39;Eve Future&quot;

(Opens to an aerial view of a large tower, with a glowing orange base.  We slowly descend, and move to a view of a being on a one-man helicopter.  It shoots to the top of the tower, and begins circling.)

<p>
&quot;Repo 202 to Control.  Arrived at target airspace.  Commencing data relay.&quot;<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
(Transfer to a view out of a car&#39;s windshield, driving through human traffic.  Base of the tower, a S.W.A.T. like group is getting ready.)
</p>
<p>
Batou: &quot;Fill me in.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The perp killed the owner 52 minutes ago, at crime scene #1, then took off.  Ambushed and murdered two cops at crime scene #2, an unmapped alley.  All access points are blocked.  We storm it in 2 minutes.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou heads towards the building.  A police officer goes to stop him, but another stops him.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;That&#39;s the cyborg cop from Section 9.  Keep your distance.  I hear his bum luck catches like the plague.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;E-police want to horn in on us.  They&#39;re asking for a data link.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;First it&#39;s Public Safety, now the E-police.  Decline their request respectfully.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Walking through an alley.  Two dead and a girl.  He approaches and she attacks, but he knocks her back.  He draws.)
</p>
<p>
&quot;Help me. Help me.&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Whispered.  She rips off her skin, and her chest falls apart, tubes and wires springing loose.  Her face does the same, and Batou fires once.)
