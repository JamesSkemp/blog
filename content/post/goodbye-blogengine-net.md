<p>On <a href="/words/Post/BlogEngineNET-now-used-by-StrivingLife">July 13, 2007</a> I converted my blog over from WordPress to BlogEngine.NET (having previously used custom code written in PHP).</p>

<p>It was a great switch, as I was beginning to really dig into .NET, and I've found there's no better way to learn something than actually doing something with it.</p>

<p>While I don't think I did much with the beta, I was in on 1.0 and was fairly active at first. Mads eventually switched focus, and there were much more vocal users, so I slowed down, and eventually stopped visiting the community.</p>

<p>This switch is long overdue, but a short while ago I started on the process of moving away from BlogEngine.NET, and late last night (or very early this morning) I pulled the switch.</p>

<p>I still have some work to do on the functionality to actually create/edit data, but at this point it's been running pretty solid, with considerably less of a memory footprint.</p>

<p>I'm hoping for a nicer design at some point, as well as additional tweaks to the functionality, but moving away from BlogEngine.NET is the first step towards those goals.</p>
