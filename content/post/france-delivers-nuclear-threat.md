What a headline ...

> Jacques Chirac, France&#39;s president, has threatened to use nuclear weapons against any state that supported terrorism against his country or considered using weapons of mass destruction.

So, terrorists are everywhere, not contained within set land boundaries.  States/governments/masses of people, on the other hand, are/can be.

Are you punishing the &#39;terrorists&#39;, or are you punishing the common man in what-so-ever country is determined to be aiding the terrorists, in that some of it&#39;s most popular few are assisting?  And, while I&#39;m against Iran developing nuclear technology, it&#39;s partially because of what France is now doing.

I&#39;m not into politics, and this is extremely political, but that&#39;s my take on this.
