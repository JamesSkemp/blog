<p>With summer right around the corner, I've been looking at solar powered fans, especially after seeing an episode of Ask This Old House where they installed an attic fan.<!--more--><!--adsense--></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks it's extremely hard to find non-attic fans, in particular smaller models that might fit in a window.</p>
<p>Since I've had such good luck with posting other items, I'm hoping that someone will come upon this and have some suggestions for where one can either purchase a pre-built, solar-powered, desk fan, or a site that walks through the creation process.</p>
<p>Even if there's no storage, it would still be nice on those warm days to have a fan that isn't pulling an electrical current ...</p>
