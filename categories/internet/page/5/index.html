  <div class="body">Unfortunately, Crucial&#39;s system scanner tool doesn&#39;t work on Linux. While unfortunate, it turns out that there&#39;s an easy way to determine how much memory you&#39;ve currently got, and how much you can increase that to, using a simple comand. sudo lshw That&#39;s all there is to it. This gives not only an overview of how much you&#39;ve got, and how much you can have, but also what banks are in use with what, and other system-related &#39;stuff.&#39; Pretty nifty.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body"><p>
Unfortunately, the &#39;Internet portal&#39; will continue to be around, but the browser is finally being put to rest.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the news out of AOL, on <a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/" target="_blank">the official blog</a> yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I&#39;m really happy to hear this, since Netscape as a browser really isn&#39;t going anywhere. Currently, it just displays content using IE or Firefox/Mozilla.
</p>
<p>
Happy news indeed, and not at all unexpected.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this means that freed talent and time will be invested wisely.

  </header>
  <div class="body">Ramblings at this point. I probably won&#39;t clean them up, but I might.&nbsp; Ars technica has a post, Microsoft patent could force downloaders to view commercials, regarding advertising before the playing and/or downloading of online content. Microsoft&#39;s patent application, titled Enforcing Advertising Playback For Downloaded Media Content, describes systems that are based both on tokens and DRM which would prohibit playing a media file unless its accompanying advertising is viewed. The technology is designed to prohibit fast-forwarding, editing, or otherwise circumventing the advertisements, though it is unclear exactly where the ads would be placed.&nbsp; Now I have a couple of experiences with online video, and can therefore give my opinion on this.</div>

Those questions, and the respective answers, have been posted below. Since his answers may have changed since early 2005, I&#39;ll be adding any additional comments he may have to the answers below. 1) I&#39;m about to read your writings - why should I?

  <div class="body">One of the view things I miss about cable is The Daily Show. Thankfully, I can now get my fix, as well as catch up on older shows, online, legally. The archives are available from the Show&#39;s Videos area. Among the gems is this one on the recent healthcare veto: Headlines - Kids&#39; Healthcare Veto. The short commercial at the beginning and end are fairly non-obtrusive, save when they cut into the end abruptly.</div>

  <div class="body">As it promises, Steve Krug&#39;s Don&#39;t Make Me Think: 2nd Edition, is a quick, but extremely usable, guide to Web usability and design. The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours total over the days of September 26 and 27, of 2007), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.</div>

Of course, I don&#39;t think I know anyone who hasn&#39;t at least done this once (even if that individual they searched for happened to be themselves). The question is, is it true that, if someone can&#39;t find a record of you online, that you&#39;re dead?</div>
