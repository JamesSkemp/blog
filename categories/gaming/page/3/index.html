                                The following is a review of the Alienware Alpha and Steam Machine Carrying Case (A7888952), provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program. Nice tight fit for the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK In February of this year I was lucky enough to receive an Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK for review. Since I&rsquo;ve been trying to be better about putting away my consoles when I&rsquo;m not actively using them, which I was treating the Alienware Steam Machine as, I was starting to look at picking up or using one of my usual containers for the purpose.

A weird hybrid First I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;m not sure how to review the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK. Do I compare it to the consoles, as that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to make (especially with SteamOS being the OS on this machine)?

                                The following is a review of the Fury of Dracula Third Edition Board Game, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program. So many pieces, but easy after a week I haven't played any of the previous editions of Fury of Dracula, so I can't speak to the changes made in this third edition. However, as I understand it, the game has changed for the better. This supports 2 to 5 players, with one player controlling Dracula and the others controlling one or more of the hunters.

                                The following is a review of Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart (2012), available on Steam and for physical purchase. A good way to get into the genre (I played the Steam version of this game, and this review is based upon that.) This was the first real hidden object game I played, thanks to a kind Reddit user who gifted me a key. It was actually quite good, with great artwork.

                                The following is a review of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous Base Set, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Too soon to tell When I saw the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game available from Amazon Vine I jumped on the chance to give it a try. Unfortunately the complexities of the game currently result in this partial review. This review will be updated in the coming days and weeks as we further play the game.

                                The following is a review of Dimension: The Spherical Stackable Fast Paced Puzzle Game, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Fun, but I don't think it'll turn into a staple (Normally I'd work this into my review, but it's a little harder this time. As noted above this is a review of a product I received for free, through Amazon. I try very hard to not let that impact my rating.) Lauge Luchau, the creator of Dimension, was once an architect.

                                The following is a review of Batman Fluxx, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Not just a minor tweak of Fluxx Ever since I was introduced to Fluxx well over a year ago (I think it was Oz Fluxx) I've been interested in the game. Thus far I've played Oz Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx, and Cthulhu Fluxx, having purchased the latter in July 2014. When I saw that a copy of Batman Fluxx was up for review I wondered how the game would play compared to the others, and requested a copy.

Just Delicious Having played the game with three different groups, consisting of 2, 4, and 5 people, I can honestly say that every group I've played it with has had a great time. I won't go into the actual rules, other than to say that they're relatively simple to learn and pick up.

                                The following is a review of Mars Attacks: The Dice Game, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Fun, but the theme may be an acquired taste Being a fan of the Mars Attacks movie, I was interested in just how well a dice game based upon it would be. The game actually puts you into the role of the Martians, and does not really tie into the movie. This is quite honestly a wise decision on their part, since personally I like playing the bad guys sometimes.

Simple enough for kids, but fun for all A number of years ago I was introduced to the SET Card Game by a former co-worker. SET is fairly basic game that requires a deal of thinking, and is something I really enjoyed playing. So when I saw the SET name on the box for the Karma Card Game I knew I had to request a copy.

A pleasant twist on the SET card game I was introduced to the SET card game a little over four years ago by a former co-worker. Having more experience than I, she kicked my butt every time we played together, but it was enjoyable, and I still did sufficiently good at the single player variant.

Very nice, but may not be required For context, I have two rather old HP monitors, from 2007, which up until early last year I was using for my PC monitors.

I somehow made it through the first two levels, and recently opted to run it for a little over an hour today to just get the trading cards (which are worth next to nothing in money and gems). I'm thankful I only paid 17 cents for this, thanks to a bundle.

Fun with a good group When initially reading over the instructions for Cash N Guns I wasn't sure how it would actually play. The idea of robbers trying to split the loot from a heist is pretty easy to understand, but would it play out fairly? Having now played the game in a group of five I think it went fairly well.

An enjoyable story, with minor puzzles I find point and click adventures to be generally enjoyable, but the older I get the more interest I have in the story they tell than the puzzles. So when I finally started playing Gray Matter, which I received for very cheap as part of a bundle, my main focus was on the story.

Enjoyable story and gameplay After having the game for a little over 9 months, I've finally beaten the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch, of Shadowrun Returns (2013). It didn't take this long to beat it because the game wasn't enjoyable, but rather because the machine I had until a few months ago wasn't ideal for gaming, so it wasn't until the last three months that I really got into this.

Great story, interesting puzzles Having liked Syberia (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up. While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.

                                The following is a review of Fearless Fantasy (2014), available for PC on Steam. Enjoyable, but controls are a bit iffy While Fearless Fantasy isn't long (there's only 13 sections), it's nonetheless an interesting game. The combat mechanic is probably more suited for touch-based devices (I found windowed mode makes the game a little easier, than playing full screen in 1920x1080), it still keeps combat interesting. Because of the mechanic, I did find myself having to grind earlier levels for experience, and ended the game with level 17 characters.

                                The following is a review of To the Moon (2011), available for PC on Steam. Good story, but iffy controls From the reviews of this game I was expecting a short game with a good story. And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.

                                The following is a review of Hexcells Plus (2014), played on the PC. More of the same, with a bit more complexity Having gone through the first Hexcells rather quickly, I just as quickly started playing the standalone Hexcells Plus. While this game contains the same number of puzzles as the original, it adds additional gameplay dynamics. While I finished the first in less than 2 hours, Steam reports that I put in 8 hours on this version.

                                The following is a review of Hexcells (2014), played on the PC. A short, but enjoyable, puzzle game Ultimately, I recommend Hexcells, especially for the price I paid ($1.25 with the standalone expansion), as I got a around 110 minutes of play. It's a pretty basic puzzle game, with some extra dynamics added in as you progress. I do wish that the puzzles were a little more complex, but I also tend to enjoy this type of game, so the general idea wasn't new to me.

                                The following is a review of Radiant Historia (2011), released for the Nintendo DS. Fantastic music and interesting branching story When I ordered Radiant Historia back in February 2013 I'll readily admit that I played for only a few hours before I let it, and my 3DS, sit and gather dust. At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.

                                The following is a review of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (2013), played on the PC. An enjoyable hack and slash dungeon crawler Having recently built a gaming PC I had to think hard about what game(s) I would initially pick up. Since Diablo II was such an enjoyable game, and one of my most memorable experiences when I was PC gaming, I initially looked at Diablo III. However, the current state of the game, and knowing that eventually the DLC and base game would be selling for half the price, led me to look elsewhere.

                                The following is a review of Ghost Trick, released in 2011, for the Nintendo DS. What a very good game A very short while ago I watched a video that featured Ghost Trick briefly, and I fell in love with the graphic style of the game. After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.

                                The following is a review of Contrast, released in 2013, for the PlayStation 4. Charming Since Watch Dogs was delayed, I've been thinking about what game would be my first PlayStation 4 experience. Between Contrast, Flower, and Resogun, I ultimately decided upon Contrast, since while I had played flOw first on my PlayStation 3, I had already played (and enjoyed) Flower on the PS3, and wanted something slightly different. Contrast is free for PlayStation Plus subscribers, of which I am one of.

A dark masterpiece I picked up a new copy of Alice: Madness Returns for the Xbox 360 back in April of 2012. Since it came with a copy of the original American Mcgee&rsquo;s Alice, I decided to start with that in May. However, it took me until November of that year to beat that game (it was good, just long), and then I didn&rsquo;t start the main game until the middle of August.

                                Last month I was playing Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention on the PlayStation Vita. I had finished the game, but had started a new game and was picking up the Diez Gentleman by losing to Raspberyl. Unfortunately, when I lost to her I kept getting the error code of C2-12828-1, and the game crashed. In my particular case I just didn't have enough room in homeroom. Unfortunately I forget the exact number, but the game wants you to keep more slots open than you need.

                                The following is a review of Tomb Raider (2013). Reboot: Successful I&rsquo;ve never bought a Tomb Raider game before this one. Actually, I did buy the Lara Croft PSN/Xbox Live game, but that&rsquo;s not really a Tomb Raider game in the classic sense. I also received a free copy of Tomb Raider: Underworld via PlayStation Plus, but I&rsquo;ve yet to finish it, and don&rsquo;t have much drive to. However, Tomb Raider is not only the first Lara Croft game I&rsquo;ve paid full price for, but one of a very few games I&rsquo;ve picked up almost immediately after it was released.

                                The following is a review of Spec Ops: The Line (2012). A squad-based shooter with an excellent story I really bought the SOCOM 4 Full Deployment Edition because at the time it was the cheapest way to quick up everything to get started with PlayStation Move. And in fact I only played it for a short time before I moved on to other games. I&rsquo;ve since tried to get back into it, but since I had issues getting the game running again (odd patch issues), I haven&rsquo;t done so.

                                Yesterday morning I committed version 1.2 of My Video Game Tracker to a public repository on GitHub. At this time I intend on letting my publishing license lapse on Windows Phone development (which is still a number of months away), and have decided that I probably won't do anything further targeting Windows Phone 7. In the coming weeks I'll probably also post the Madison Metro application that I was working on, warts and all.

Ignore the cover, Onechanbara actually isn&rsquo;t that bad Honestly, I hesitated bringing this up to the counter to pay for it.&nbsp;However, with the 3-point-something rating, new copies selling for over $60, and the store having it used for $6.30, I had to pick up Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad. I&rsquo;ll admit it, as I guy who likes girls sex can get me to purchase something, and Onechanbara certainly promises that.

If you enjoyed The Saboteur, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this While I was playing Mafia II I was constantly reminded of The Saboteur (2009), and since I enjoyed that game, I would consider that a good thing.&nbsp;The game features much of the same, with gun and hand fights (the latter of which plays an important part in the story) and driving.

                                The following is a review of Ninja Blade (2009), for the Xbox 360. A lot of quick time events, but an overlooked gem God of War was a pretty good game, but the game made popular quick time events, which I absolutely despised. When I saw Ninja Blade at a used media store I was taken back by how little it cost, for what seemed like a fairly enjoyable game, similar to Ninja Gaiden (note: Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360 is kicking my butt, but I fully plan on finishing it, have picked up Sigma for the PlayStation 3, and am semi-interested in picking up others in the series).

                                The following is a review of Yakuza Dead Souls (2012), released for the PlayStation 3. Inconsistent targeting is easily overlooked in this gem When I first heard about Yakuza Dead Souls I was a little worried. The best part about the Yakuza series is the story, and I feared that they were jumping on the zombie bandwagon (albeit late). However, I should have reminded myself about the multitude of games I have that has the Sega logo on the box, as there was nothing to fear with this iteration in the Yakuza series.

MindJack got a lot of grief when it came out, and it hasn&rsquo;t gotten much better. However, seeing it for under $5 one day, I decided to pick up a copy and see just how bad it really is. MindJack tells the story of a man who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t remember (and that I don&rsquo;t care enough to look up) as he tries to discover what he can, as within the first few minutes of the game he&rsquo;s treated as something of a traitor.

A wonderful short story When Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was first being discussed I was keeping my eye on it, as I had picked up Heavenly Sword when I picked up my PlayStation 3 and thorougly enjoyed it.&nbsp;However, after lackluster reviews I opted to wait until I picked it up.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it took this long to finally do so.

Over the top antics delivers just what I needed After the bombardment of commercials online for this game, I had it on my list to pick up after the price dropped into the $20 range. However, since PlayStation 3 users can get a free copy of Saints Row 2 by picking it up before January or February of next year, and the price at retailers had dropped to $40, I decided to pick up a copy early.

Amazing value, for a great RPG A while ago a friend lent me his copy of Dragon Age Origins for the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed the game, I had a number of other games that I was playing, and I returned it without finishing it. With the price drops of the Ultimate Edition, I decided to finally pick up a copy, for the PS3, but it sat unused until a short time ago.

                                The following is a review of The 3rd Birthday for the PlayStation Portable. Fairly incomprehensible story, but wonderful game play Way back in 2005 I found a copy of Parasite Eve. While I tried playing through the game shortly after, it wasn&rsquo;t until many years later that I actually started and finished the game (twice). I also happened to come upon a copy of Parasite Eve 2, but outside of a very little bit of play (less than an hour), I never really got into the game.

                                Going through the game Nier yet again, I wanted an easier way to track what weapon levels I had already upgraded to, and what items I still needed to unlock weapon items. Phase one towards that goal is creating an XML file with weapon upgrade information which is available online: Nier weapon data. An XML schema document for this information is also available: Nier weapon XSD. Sample LINQ query The following query can be run from LINQPAD, and will either display all items with their counts, or a grouped listing of items with the total quantity needed.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 4 for the PlayStation 3. A masterpiece I picked up Yakuza 4 without having played any of the previous iterations of the game. After looking at reviews online I thought it might have a pretty good story, and provide a good amount of entertainment. After playing a little under an hour of the game I was quite impressed what I had seen. Used copies of Yakuza 3 were available locally, at a pretty decent price, so I decided to pick up a copy of Yakuza 3 and play that first (since Yakuza 1 and 2 were a little harder to find, and more importantly on the PlayStation 2).

                                The following is a review of Last Rebellion for the PlayStation 3. It&rsquo;s interesting how badly this game is generally rated, yet I didn&rsquo;t find the approximately 12 hours I put into the game all that horrible. Sure the graphics don&rsquo;t push the limits of the PlayStation 3, and the game could certainly have been released for the PlayStation 2, but given the current pricing of the game I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s worth a purchase.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 3, for the PlayStation 3. Around the time Yakuza 4 was being released I began hearing about the game, although after further research I do remember hearing about those who had asked actual Yakuza to play a Yakuza game (the 3rd specifically). Either way, everything I had heard about 4 suggested I would like it, especially when I heard it had a great story.

                                The following is a review of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, and released on the PlayStation Network. I just recently picked up a copy of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, as it was on sale for PlayStation Plus members. According to some Eat Them! is a Rampage-like game, where you control a monster that lays waste to an area of a city. Indeed, this an extremely apt description, as playing this game brought to my mind fond memories of putting quarters/tokens into the Rampage machine, and later playing it, and later releases (such as for the Nintendo 64) to mind.

                                The following is a review of Bullet Witch, released in 2006 for the Xbox 360. It is what it is, and that&rsquo;s just fine Years ago I was hooked by the uniqueness of the first few levels of Drakengard, released for the PlayStation 2. When I finally found and picked up a copy I found it had hooked its claws into me even more.&nbsp;So when Drakengard 2 came out I of course picked up a copy.

I've finally gotten to the point where I wanted to try creating a jQuery Mobile version of my video game listing. View the jQuery Mobile version of my video games listing. In addition to jQuery Mobile, this also uses oXygen XML Editor, for taking the original XML source and transforming it via an XSLT 2.0 solution to generate the HTML.

                                I've had Final Fantasy VIII for many years, but have never finished it. In fact, I've never gotten through the first disc. However, having recently started it up once again, after picking up an electronic copy on the PSN (I still have the original, but this is the only legit way to play it on my PSP), I have to say that Final Fantasy VIII contains my favorite mini-game of the series, and perhaps one of my top favorites of all.

                                The following is a review of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno (2010), available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Enjoyable, but quick, with some annoying platforming As I continue playing games that received less than critical acclaim, I found myself playing Dante&rsquo;s Inferno for the Xbox 360. Dante&rsquo;s Inferno tells the story of Dante who journeys through Hell to save his beloved Beatrice. As we progress through the story we learn more about Dante himself, and why it is that he doesn&rsquo;t seem so out of place in this land.

                                The following is a review of Darksiders (2009), available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Darksiders, like Nier, the last game I played through and beat, didn&rsquo;t get all that much respect when it first came out. But Darksiders features more than just God of War meets Zelda gameplay, it tells a story worth seeing through until the end. The following review is based upon a playthrough on the Xbox 360, on the hardest -&nbsp;Apocalyptic - difficulty.

                                The following is a review of Nier (2010), available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Yes, the main character is ugly, but the story is anything but Nier, released in 2010, and developed by Cavia, gained mediocre reviews when it was released. The one thing I remember most about those reviews is the common statement that the main character in Nier was rather ugly. Of course, he (named whatever you name him) is rather ugly.

                                The following is a review of Parasite Eve, for the Sony PlayStation (1). Almost six years ago, back in 2005, I found and picked up a copy of Parasite Eve. I don&rsquo;t recall the exact circumstances on why I picked it up, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that seeing &lsquo;Squaresoft&rsquo; on the jewel case had more than a little to do with it. With The 3rd Birthday&rsquo;s U.S. launch fast approaching, I put the first Parasite Eve back on my list, having not played it since a short time after I bought it, and even then not having finished the game.

                                The following is a review of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, for the Sony PlayStation Portable. Having played Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 years ago, I skipped most of the other iterations of the Kingdom Hearts series either because I didn&rsquo;t have the console (DS) or because the games just didn&rsquo;t seem to have the same appeal (Chain of Memories). Shortly before picking up my PSP I heard a lot of really great things about this game, with most reviews saying it had a good story, graphics, and an improved combat system, but a quirky camera.

                                Former colleague Rob Lumley posted an article a few months ago about Netflix instant viewing. While responding to another comment I had an epiphany. The PSPgo was Sony's attempt to go all digital for game distribution. And it wasn't much of a success, especially since not all games are available (even recent titles, like the 'new' Kingdom Hearts). However, the iPhone, iPod Touch, and now iPad use completely digital distribution for their games, and they're doing absolutely wonderful.

                                Techmeme had a couple of interesting titles this evening. "Kinect is Selling 2X as Fast as the iPad" and "Microsoft: Over 2.5M Kinect Sold." Even if I thought I had the space for it (I'd have to move furniture every time I wanted to play it in my current apartment) I still wouldn't pick up the Kinect. Why? First there's the price. At $150 you might as well buy a PSP (which I did) or a Nintendo DSi.

                                This is a review of the Sony PlayStation Portable game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VII was the game that made me want a PlayStation 1. I played Final Fantasy VII briefly after it was initially released at a friend&rsquo;s house, then my own copies later in college on both the PC and PlayStation 1. So when&nbsp;I ordered a PlayStation Portable (PSP)&nbsp;recently&nbsp;it seemed like a no-brainer to pick up a copy of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII as one of my first games.

                                At the lowest level, any Sudoku puzzle consists of a number of squares. There are&nbsp;rows times columns squares consisting of a single value. There are x number of larger squares consisting of&nbsp;y&nbsp;values, where&nbsp;x is the smallest of rows&nbsp;and columns, and y is the largest of rows and columns. As already mentioned, there are a x number of rows, as well as a y number of columns. Overlap is possible, but the puzzle still consists of these basic parts.

                                Having just received this month's issue of Game Informer I was pleasantly suprised by the article 'The 30 Characters Who Defined A Decade,' contained on pages 46 to 69. I was particularly surprised to see Elena Fisher on the list, since Nathan Drake was already present, but feel that was an excellent choice. Lost Odyssey doesn't show up as much as I feel it should, so it was great to see Kaim Argonar showing up on the list.

                                I've spent a great portion of the day researching current gen portable consoles; the Nintendo DS(i) and Sony PSP. MLB for the latter was disappointing (I'm not much of a sports fan, so no surprise), but the Pokemon (I'm ashamed to admit) game was a blast. If any of the stores in Madison actually carried the Metal Gear PSP bundle I would have purchased it, even though I logically have a difficult time justifying it.

                                This afternoon I picked up a PlayStation 2 slim model from Best Buy. I've already got a fat PS2, from way back in 2004 (after a bit of research, it looks like January, and that I paid about $200 for it), that still works pretty darn good, although the controllers are a bit ... discouraging. My PlayStation 3 is also backwards compatible, so between the two I should be able to play my 52 PlayStation 2 (plus those I purchase in the future, as purchase I will)&nbsp;games for many years into the future.
