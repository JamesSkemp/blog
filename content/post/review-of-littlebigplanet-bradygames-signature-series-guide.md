First of all, this is a beautiful guide. Every time I pick up one of the Brady Games guides I&#39;m impressed with the quality of the actual item. Nice smooth pages, great colors, etcetera. 
</p>
<p>
About 66% of this guide deals with the story mode. This involves a checklist of items for each level, as well as hints and tips on completing them successfully. 
</p>
<p>
The remainder handles the level creation tools, which is really where the replay value of LittleBigPlanet is going to be. Once you&#39;ve read this, you&#39;ll be able to create your own level with relative ease. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, LittleBigPlanet itself has tutorials for most of the items you can use to build levels, but having it in one place for future review is timeless. 
</p>
<p>
So, all-in-all, a very solid book. 
</p>
<p>
The minor issues I mentioned in my review title are solely that: 
</p>
<p>
a) There&#39;s no overview map of the story levels. Granted, these levels are rather large, but I&#39;d still like to see a couple of pages near the beginning, with the full maps. 
</p>
<p>
b) A comprehensive checklist of items. In other words, here&#39;s all of the stickers, and where you can find them. Etcetera. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I&#39;m also not seeing a listing of items you receive after doing the tutorials. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I can&#39;t remove an entire star because of these two minor issues, so 4.5 stars is rounded to 5. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;You&#39;ll use most of the guide for 100% completion in story mode, once, and refer to the rest for as long as the level creation functionality keeps your interest.
