<p>
If you have the pleasure of running Cisco&#39;s Cache Cleaner on your home computer, you may run into an issue with your settings being set to something other than you&#39;d prefer. 
</p>
<p>
While it may appear that Cache Cleaner clears out your data, it in fact only appears to turn auto-complete off. 
</p>
<p>
In Internet Explorer 7, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Content &gt; AutoComplete &gt; Settings and turn the settings you want back on.
