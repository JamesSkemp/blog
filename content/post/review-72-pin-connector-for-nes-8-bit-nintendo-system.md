<p>The following is a review of a <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DLOM6C?tag=strivinglifen-20">72 Pin Connector for NES 8 BIT Nintendo System (Bulk Packaging)</a>, by Classic Game Source.</p>
</div>
<p>Our Nintendo was purchased new (as far as I know), way back when they were still being sold in stores.</p>
<p>However, we haven't played it all that much, since, like many others, the console would blink instead of playing the game.</p>
<p>Last weekend I visited my sister, who has it now, and I couldn't get it come on at all. A common issue seems to be the 72-pin connector, so I decided to finally take it back with me and give that a shot.</p>
<p>I don't recall our NES ever starting a game as soon as you press the power, so I was absolutely shocked (but not enough to hold back my shout of joy) when it started a game immediately.</p>
<p>Some suggest pulling the pins back into position, but quite honestly our pins were completely flat (no resistance when sliding in a game) and I'm sure the time it would have taken would have been more than the $12 I paid for a new one.</p>
<p>Read a good guide on replacing it (I used <a rel="external" href="http://www.hitgaming.com/connectorinstall2.html">Hitgaming</a>'s, which comes up for a Google search for 'nes replace 72 pin connector') and enjoy playing your NES again!</p>
