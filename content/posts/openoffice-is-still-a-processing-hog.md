I think that OpenOffice is where things are heading in the future.<!--more-->

Some say that the next platform for word processors will be the Internet.  Need to write a document?  Go online to do so.  Yet, with Internet security the way it is, not to mention that a number of people still don&#39;t have always-on connections, we&#39;re just not ready for that quite yet.  One day, yes, but not quite yet.<!--adsense-->

Back to OpenOffice, there is a problem with it, however - it&#39;s a hog when it comes to installation.  It&#39;s time for programs to start acting like anti-virus software (and yes, I did mention this in a previous post) and allow us to only update the components that need to be updated.  Is there a difference between your average program and an AV program?  Sure, the core components of your average program are often what&#39;s getting updated.  AV programs are built to expect updates, in the form of new definitions.
</p>
<p>
Yet, updates to the core components of AV programs happen, and they&#39;re fairly similar to regular updates.  Every once in a while one may require a restart of the computer, but certainly not as often as other (and I&#39;m talking non-MS software here as well) programs.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s time for programs to take yet another look at AV software, this time not just for how they get updates, but also for <em>how</em> they update.

The solution is Linux. Having used Ubuntu for the last couple of months, it&#39;s apparent that they&#39;re definitely doing updates right, while the Windows world continues to fight with this issue of updating.
