<h3>[2 Opening Credits]</h3>
<p>
(We see what appears to be Kusanagi getting &#39;created&#39; as the opening credits roll.) 
</p>
<p>
(Once finished, we see Kusanagi laying down, and opening her eyes, as if waking from a dream. She moves her fingers slightly.) 
</p>
<p>
(She gets up, gets dressed, and leaves.)
