<h3>Reason #1</h3>
<p>
Mr. ROFL. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #2</h3>
<p>
I already own a Playstation and Playstation 2. When I can get a machine that will play those games, why wouldn&#39;t I keep with it? After all, the Playstation has never failed me. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #3</h3>
<p>
Free online play. With wi-fi support built-in. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #4</h3>
<p>
Heavenly Sword. This was the first real Playstation 3 game I played. With the trailers, I was expecting a Devil May Cry kind of game, but wow. I haven&#39;t played God of War (I&#39;ll probably pick up a copy at some point), but if this is the female version of God of War ... 
</p>
<h3>Reason #5</h3>
<p>
The ring of death. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #6</h3>
<p>
The controller.&nbsp;Honestly, the Xbox 360 feels really awkward. On the other hand, the Sixaxis controller does take a little practice. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #7</h3>
<p>
Not only does it play regular DVDs without problem, it plays Blu-ray videos as well. Right out of the box. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #8</h3>
<p>
The Playstation 3 doesn&#39;t become a&nbsp;fire hazard once you plug it in.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h3>Reason #9</h3>
<p>
It&#39;s so quiet, you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s on. 
</p>
<h3>Reason #10</h3>
<p>
The Playstation 3 is overpriced? Of course, once you factor in what you need to purchase in order to make the Xbox 360 comparable in features ... you&#39;re out of luck. 
</p>
<p>
And why would you offer a Halo 3 version of your machine, and not include Halo 3 with the purchase? That&#39;s questionable marketing practices.
