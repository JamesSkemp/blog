The following is a review of the DII Natural Coir Fiber, 18x30" Entry Way Outdoor Door Mat with Non Slip Backing - Home Cat, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## So Far Works Great Outdoors

First, based upon Amazon reviews it appears that there's some number of individuals who are selling rip-off and/or copy-cat versions of DII's doormats. Given the quality of doormat I received, I would highly recommend making sure you purchase this product from an Amazon Prime eligible seller.

That said, I've used two other DII products in the past: a [pair of oven mitts][oven-mitts] which I gave two of five stars, and a [throw][throw] which I gave four of five stars. So, hit or miss so far.

Happily, having used the [DII Natural Coir Fiber Door Mat][review] for two weeks so far I'm quite impressed.

Currently we're undergoing winter where I live, which means that having a good doormat is pretty key. We have this sitting in front of our main door and the design on the front is still holding strong, with no visible wear.

Out of the box, both colors were quite vibrant, looking quite like the product photo, and they're still holding up.

The thickness is pretty good, and it successfully captures snow so it doesn't track inside, but thus far I can't speak to how well it does with mud, but will update once I do.

So with all that said, I'm quite happy with the [DII door mat][review], and give it five of five stars. Beware of receiving an authentic product, and this doormat should serve you well.
