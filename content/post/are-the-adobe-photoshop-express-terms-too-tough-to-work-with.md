<p>
Recently the much anticipated <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/express/" target="_blank">Photoshop Express</a> was released. However, crawling through the general terms of use there&#39;s a rather troublesome paragraph. 
</p>
<p>
Using the terms that are effective 3/1/2008, at <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/express/terms.html" target="_blank">http://www.photoshop.com/express/terms.html</a>, we have the following at 8.a.: 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>

However, with respect to Your Content that you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services, <strong>you grant Adobe a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other Materials or works in any format or medium now known or later developed.</strong> 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Emphasis is my own.)

<p>
I&#39;m lucky enough to have a copy of Photoshop CS2, but this paragraph has effectively removed it as an alternative while on someone else&#39;s machine, or as something I can recommend to others, professionally. 
</p>
<p>
Now if the individual has their photo&nbsp;on some of the various 2.0 photo social networks, then I can recommend this, since their photos are effectively for anyone to do with as they will (&#39;dump your friends&#39;). 
</p>
<p>
But, as someone who wants to protect his work product ...
