<p>
As of this morning, exactly 1,000 spam have been caught by Akismet for this site.  Not too shabby.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know when this started, but it was before I got really hit.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

On that note, Akismet 1.15 has also been released.  Included in this is the big addition of a delete button at the bottom of the page (for those of us that look over comments).
