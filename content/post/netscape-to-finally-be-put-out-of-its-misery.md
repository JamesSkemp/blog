<p>
Unfortunately, the &#39;Internet portal&#39; will continue to be around, but the browser is finally being put to rest.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the news out of AOL, on <a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/" target="_blank">the official blog</a> yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I&#39;m really happy to hear this, since Netscape as a browser really isn&#39;t going anywhere. Currently, it just displays content using IE or Firefox/Mozilla.
</p>
<p>
Happy news indeed, and not at all unexpected.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this means that freed talent and time will be invested wisely.
