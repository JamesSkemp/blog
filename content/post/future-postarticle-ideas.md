<p>
The following are some of the ideas I have for articles that I&#39;ll need to actually flesh out, or sit down and write. This page will be updated as articles are eventually written (and removed from this page) or as more ideas are added. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ColdFusion MX 8 installation (added 8/16/07)<br />
	</li>
	<li>&#39;Marriage and children&#39; (added 8/16/07)
	<ul>
		<li>The economic, political, and social reasons, and whether they still hold ground today</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Husserl and intentionality/phenomenology</li>
</ul>
<br />
