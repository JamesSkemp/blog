<p>
I like Dreamweaver. After Notepad, and various other apps like it, I used FrontPage, was scarred, and was saved by Dreamweaver. 
</p>
<p>
However, Dreamweaver can&#39;t handle .NET files very well. So when I moved to Windows and started using BlogEngine.NET I naturally started looking at how I could edit the source files. 
</p>
<p>
Visual Web Developer 2005 had been released, so ... 
</p>
<p>
Skipping forward, I&#39;m starting to work with Visual Studio more and more. 
</p>
<p>
However, I&#39;ve been using Dreamweaver so long that I&#39;ve gotten used to the shortcuts that I use on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>
Ctrl + Shift + P = new paragraph 
</p>
<p>
Ctrl + 1 (through 6) = new h1 (through h6)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem that you can map these to keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio. 
</p>
<p>
Grr ...
</p>
<p>
Does anyone out there know how to map these specific functions?
</p>
