The following is a review of the [Unusual Suspects Board Game][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## The Game of Stereotypes

The first and only game of this I played lasted one round.

One round because we eliminated the guilty party.

One round because no one wanted to play a second game.

Initially I thought this was going to be similar to Guess Who. And it is, but how you determine the guilty party is by looking at the individual's photo and coming up with what stereotype(s) they match.

And there's no easy way to say this, but the game suffers because of it. Unfortunately, since the quality of the game components are pretty good, this game will never be played again by me, as I don't know who I'd play it with.

Until alternate rules come along to use the components of the card but scrap the stereotypes, the [Unusual Suspects Board Game][review] gets one of five stars from me.
