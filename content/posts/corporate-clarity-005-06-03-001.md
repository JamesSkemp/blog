Dear Team,
</p>
<p>
What would you think about us slowing down the search display so that we can have a small, non-obtrusive, flash animation of a running man, or rambling mouse?
</p>
<p>
This way, our users would be completely entertained while waiting for their search results.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your consideration of this important idea,
</p>
<p>
Your Web Development Team
