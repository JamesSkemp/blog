<blockquote>
	<p>
	The old ones walk down the road on their way to eternity<br />
	They do not stop on the way, they merely make their way<br />
	On ... on ... on stopping for none - needing no help
	</p>
	<p>
	They brought what they need on their back<br />
	They need not turn back<br />
	They do not look behind them, to see that which they have left behind<br />
	They are happy with that which has passed, with that which has occured
	</p>
	<p>
	Is their humour among these men - no, none that anyone can see<br />
	Yet their hearts are not empty, their hearts are not still<br />
	They walk yet they live, like few others do<br />
	They know that they have done what they must, what they can
	</p>
