<p>
Here&#39;s what my answer is:
</p>
<p>
No, I did the standard Philosophy major with a minor in Humanistic Studies.
</p>
<p>
In high school I liked doing Web stuff, even though my stuff was *horrible*, but I didn&#39;t want to do that for a career (hard to make a career out of something you love, and still keep that love alive - or so they say).
</p>
<p>
Originally I was going for Psychology, but I was told that wouldn&#39;t be a good field for me, and my Biology grades were horrid. So, sophmore year I had to pick, and Fiala was the one professor that seemed to really like what he taught, and I felt comfortable talking to him.
</p>
<p>
I figured I would switch once I knew what I really wanted to do, but ... that never really happened.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the old school philosophy students left, and it was just Chris Barlowe and Dustin (if I&#39;m remembering that correctly), that&#39;s where I really started liking philosophy.
</p>
<p>
Then I got out of college, took three months off to do nothing, and got a temp job in late April.
</p>
<p>
My second job was at the State Bar for cleaning up content that they had moved into a content management system, for their new site.
</p>
<p>
It was supposed to just be a couple of months, but it kept growing and growing. Since I had people to learn from, I did more and more with Web, and in a much more compliant way, and started moving into more dynamic languages. Of course, being a Microsoft shop, and a few years ago, the technology cost too much for me to use the exact tools we used at the Bar, so I worked with PHP, much more than before.
</p>
<p>
*whew*
</p>
<p>
<br />
Really, if you think about it, philosophy and Web development really aren&#39;t that different. One of the classes I took under Null was a logic class, which I both liked and did well in (contrary to most of the Humanistic Studies classes I took, outside of those that were also Philosophy).
</p>
<p>
Unless you&#39;re willing to go against Philosophy, the love of knowledge (wisdom), you have to be practical; you have to build upon knowledge and constantly strive for it.
</p>
<p>
With the Web, and technology in general, things constantly change. There&#39;s *so much* out there that you can never stop learning, and at the same time, never know all there is to know.
</p>
<p>
Much like philosophy, it can be, to a certain extent, horrifying. There are hundreds of different ways to solve any problem.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also the creative aspect of Web &#39;stuff&#39; that excites me (if you will). With words you can create an interface that has actual functionality. Honestly, it probably stems from my inability to draw; I can&#39;t draw but I can create a semi-pretty Web site ... out of nothing. You truly start with a blank screen, and with a few &#39;strokes&#39; have definition.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s powerful stuff.
</p>
<p>
You also bugs in code which points out that every behaviour is caused. While a bug is unwanted, there&#39;s always a reason, or justification, for the bug. Just like life. Ah, a philosophical truth! (For Schopenhauer, all has a ground, or basis.)
</p>
<p>
Coding is also grounded deep in reality, while sometimes philosophy seems like an abyss. Even if you do the most sophmoric philosophical problem - Descartes&#39; - that&#39;s terrifying. How do I really know anything outside of myself? If I can&#39;t trust my senses, ..., ... Yikes.
</p>
<p>
So, I have to switch between philosophy and technology. So similar, but yet so different.
</p>
<p>
And really, how do you make money with philosophy? I don&#39;t want to teach undergrads, but I wouldn&#39;t mind being one again. I definitely think when I get to that age, or perhaps when I hit a great crisis in my life (it&#39;ll probably be before 40), I&#39;ll go back to school and take lots of philosophy courses. Lee definitely had the right idea ...
