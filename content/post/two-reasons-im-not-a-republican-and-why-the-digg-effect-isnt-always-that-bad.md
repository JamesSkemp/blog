Since neither by themselves would make a full post, two items in one.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Two reasons I&#39;m not a Republican? Why not three:
</p>
<p>
1) My family was once poor enough that we had to use food stamps.
</p>
<p>
2) I&#39;m still young enough that I can (remember my) dream(s) that doesn&#39;t revolve around wealth.
</p>
<p>
3) Few things are worse than the arrogance of the majority of Republicans. I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s from, but it seems like the majority (but it may just be the vocal minority) go too far.

I was Dugg a while back (a little under a month), but it was hardly worth mentioning because of the trickle of traffic I was getting, and continue to get. I was amazed I hadn&#39;t been Dugg before on this particular post, but it appears it took over two years for it to happen.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the relatively unknown Stumbled Upon has brought me far more traffic than Digg.
