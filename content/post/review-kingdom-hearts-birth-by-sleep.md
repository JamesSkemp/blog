<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0GZ5Y?tag=strivinglifen-20">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a>, for the Sony PlayStation Portable.</p>
</div>
<p>Having played Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 years ago, I skipped most of the other iterations of the Kingdom Hearts series either because I didn't have the console (DS) or because the games just didn't seem to have the same appeal (Chain of Memories).</p>
<p>Shortly before picking up my PSP I heard a lot of really great things about this game, with most reviews saying it had a good story, graphics, and an improved combat system, but a quirky camera.</p>
<p>Having put almost 43 hours into the game, over the course of 10 days (having completed it yesterday), I can honestly say this game has been one of the most enjoyable I've played in the last year.</p>
<p>The game features a combat system similar to the first two Kingdom Hearts games, and <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Review-Crisis-Core-Final-Fantasy-VII.aspx">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</a>. The story, while a little confusing because we follow three (playable) characters, is pretty good. I only wish I had remembered more about the first Kingdom Hearts, since it's a prequel to the events that take place there (although if you haven't played the other games in the series you'll still do fine). I'm once again a little embarrassed that I'm enjoying a game featuring Disney characters, but Square once again merges the different characters together very nicely.</p>
<p>Voice acting for all characters is decent to great.</p>
<p>As noted above, I've put at least 42 hours into the game, completing each character's stories, and the final episode, but could easily put a dozen hours more into the game getting further completion and in the arena (which is still enjoyable, even though I don't know anyone else with a PSP).</p>
<p>All-in-all, I give this game 5 stars across the board. Square and Disney have really hit the mark with this game.</p>
