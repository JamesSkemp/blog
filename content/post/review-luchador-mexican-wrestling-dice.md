The following is a review of Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Thematic Dice Rolling Game, For Better or Worse

I know very little about Luchadors, other than that they wear pretty distinctive masks and attire. And I know something about wrestling having been a young boy in the 80s and 90s.

[Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice][review] doesn't require that you know much more than that, as it does a fairly good job of being quite thematic out of the box. Not only does it include characters, it includes a 3D ring to put them in, including ropes.

The names of the nine characters seem to fit well with the characters, and their special moves pretty descriptive.

But at the base [Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice][review] is a dice rolling game, for better or worse (the latter if dice generally aren't lucky when you roll).

Two Luchador's roll against each other, with dice either being misses, attacks, blocks, counters, or pins. All dice are then compared with any final attacks resulting in different dice being rolled, or if two attacks are rolled, a single, more powerful, die can be used.

This continues until a Luchador is weak enough to be pinned, in which case a pin attempt can be made.

In the last game I played, the team I was on made a pin attempt which was then reversed and lead to a successful pin. This was after they had made a couple unsuccessful tag outs and were cursing the dice.

As just noted, while the game says it will two to six, this is really more like two, four, or six. It also says it takes about 15 minutes to play, but depending upon the dice things can go faster or slower.

Each character's abilities also are different only in flavor text, which is also a little unfortunate, but makes for a balanced game depending only upon the luck of the dice.

I'd also highly recommend watching a video on how to play the game. I watched one featuring a father and daughter and someone involved with the game and found it a good way to learn to play, versus the rules which are a little all over the place.

I'm honestly not much of a dice game person, since the dice generally don't like me, and when they do like me they don't like the people I'm playing with/trying to teach the game to. For me, this means that despite how thematic the game is, I have to give it three of five stars. If you like dice games and/or the Luchador theme, than you might find it more enjoyable, while if neither appeals to you than you can safely skip [Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice][review].
