Tip: If using the HDMI cable to connect your HP w2207h to a computer (such as the HP Pavilion a6360t), you do not need to connect the monitor to the computer&#39;s audio card.

If you switch this, you may also need to close out of programs,&nbsp;such as Internet Explorer 7,&nbsp;in order for them to use the correct audio device.
