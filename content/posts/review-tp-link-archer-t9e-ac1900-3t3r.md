<p>The following is a review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQEX7AQ?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">TP-LINK Archer T9E AC1900 Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter, 5Ghz 1300Mbps + 2.4Ghz 600Mbps, Beamforming, 3T3R</a>, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p>

<h3>On par with a wired connection, but mind the size</h3>

<p>I've used one other TP-LINK product, an AC1200 USB adapter, which I generally found to be acceptable. So when I saw this I thought about another machine I could switched from a networked connection to a wireless one.</p>

<p>For the most part the adapter itself was easy enough to install. One slight downside is that the adapter has a larger footprint, so you'll want to make sure that your PC will have a bit of space. On my main gaming rig the adapter would not have fit due to my graphics card. However, on my desktop development PC it fit without issue.</p>

<p>Regarding the software, after installing the software from the disc a reboot was still required. It's been a while since Windows wasn't able to automatically install the necessary drivers, so maybe a reboot is common, but it wasn't something I was expecting. I also ran into an issue with the installer itself spawning multiple setups due to drop-down responsiveness in the setup wizard.</p>

<p>However, after getting the hardware and drivers installed I ended up with ping and upload and download speeds on par with my wired connection, and didn't require any additional software to run to connect to any of my wired connections.</p>

<p>Other than the footprint of the device, and the odd wizard that you'll only have to deal with once, I had no issues with this, and give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQEX7AQ?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">TP-LINK Archer T9E AC1900 Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter, 5Ghz 1300Mbps + 2.4Ghz 600Mbps, Beamforming, 3T3R</a> 5 of 5 stars.</p>
