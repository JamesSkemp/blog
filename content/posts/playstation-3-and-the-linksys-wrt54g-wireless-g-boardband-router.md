<p>
While I initially hooked up my Playstation 3 a week ago, when I was posting to the official PS forums today, my second post, I was doing so to recommend a version of the router I&#39;m using. Since both items are pretty popular now, it makes sense to write up a quick guide on them, I suppose. 
</p>
<h3>My equipment</h3>
<p>
First off, there&#39;s my setup. I&#39;ve had pretty experiences with Linksys, but poor experiences with Netgear, so Linksys I am. I&#39;ve got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005T6GZ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005T6GZ" target="_blank">BEFCMU10 Cable Modem</a> connected to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007KDVI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00007KDVI" target="_blank">WRT54G Wireless-G Broadband Router</a> (Wireless-B and -G compatible). 
</p>
<h3>The setup</h3>
<p>
My router can be configured at <a href="http://192.168.1.1/">http://192.168.1.1/</a>&nbsp;(the default). 
</p>
<p>
I setup the wireless (<a href="http://192.168.1.1/wireless.htm">http://192.168.1.1/wireless.htm</a>) as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	Wireless Network Mode: Mixed 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Wireless Channel: 6 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Wireless SSID Broadcast: Disable 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Security Mode: WEP 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	WEP Encryption: 64 bits 10 hex digits 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	other than a unique SSID, everything else should be defaults. 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	I did not have to do any port &#39;stuff&#39; under &quot;Applications &amp; Gaming.&quot; 
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Playstation 3 setup, with Wireless, went very smoothly. Since the router is in the same room, there&#39;s obviously 100% signal strength. While I haven&#39;t played Warhawk, I have downloaded a number of videos and demos, and have spent a deal of time surfing online. The download speeds are &#39;eh&#39; but I don&#39;t know what speed it really is; files are downloading pretty quick (it would be nice to see an indication of download speeds).

<p>
I heard a number of things about the PS3 media server, so this is disabled on my machine.

<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>
Questions/comments on the router should be left below. Please refrain from comments focusing on the Playstation 3. 
</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
I neglected to list my download/upload speeds, according to SpeedTest.net: 
</p>
<p>
4.6&nbsp;mb / 480 kb on my computer, but only 1.7 mb / 480 kb on my PS 3.
