<p>
After a good number of years, I&#39;ve finally got new glasses ...
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve had my previous frames, but I believe I put two different lenses into them. Part of the reason is I don&#39;t care too much about my glasses - I just want glasses that work.
</p>
<p>
So, I went to Lenscrafters and worked with Candace (sp?), and with some assistance from my sister, I picked up two pairs; one pair of regular, and one pair of sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
The sunglasses are Ray-Ban, and that&#39;s all I know.
</p>
<p>
More money than I would have liked to have spent on glasses, but the frames should last me as long as my previous ones (at least five years, probably a good deal more ...)&nbsp;
</p>
