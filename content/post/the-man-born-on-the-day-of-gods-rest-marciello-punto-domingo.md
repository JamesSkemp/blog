In 1875, in a small Italian town, the fragmentary writings of Marciello Punto, Domingo were found in a collection of lose papers in a small bookstore. While the significance of the find would not be apparent for almost 70 years later, the significance of those writings today is quite clear. Unfortunately, much of the world, especially the United States, is unaware of this great Italian poet, something which I wish to alleviate today.

While the exact birth place and time of Marciello Punto, Domingo is unknown, there have been a number of guesses. Some believe that he was born in the late 1700s, while others believe that he was born around 1825. Unfortunately, no concrete record of Marciello Punto, Domingo has ever been found, outside of a few literary pieces. In 1860, for example, there is a small allusion to Marciello Punto, Domingo in the writings of Raul Renzo.

<blockquote>
	<p>
	&quot;Throughout my life I believed that no one knew what I was going through, until my eyes alighted upon the words of Marciello Punto, words that I shall never forget &#39;There was madness and chaos, and the children were weeping.&#39; From then on I knew that my task was to write.&quot;

In at least two other works this same line has been quoted, although with no reference. However, since these works are dated to be written after 1850 to 1860, the general consensus is that these writings are Marciello Punto, Domingo&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
Further evidence of Marciello existence during this period is fragmentary and questionable at best. In a local writing of the time, we see mention of a &#39;fiery Domingo Marciello&#39;, who wrecks havoc wherever he goes. However, because the writings come primarily from church sources, it is questionable whether or not Domingo Marciello wrecks physical or spiritual havoc, for if we are to take the fragment as a basis for all of his works, then Marciello would appear to be arguing for the absence of order.

Unfortunately, further information regarding Marciello Punto, Domingo has been lost in time, or his history consists only of the fragments here mentioned. Perhaps he is best summed up by his famous writing, &quot;Ci era follia e caos ed i bambini stavano piangendo.&quot; (There was madness and chaos, and the children were weeping.), or perhaps by the journal of the clergyman who writes &quot;&Egrave; talmente odioso... quando &egrave; nato, Dio era in vacanza...&quot;, and elsewhere, &quot;quando &egrave; nato, Dio non c&#39;era, e se c&#39;era dormiva.&quot;
