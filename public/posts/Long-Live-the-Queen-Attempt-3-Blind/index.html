<p>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: We're almost home. Your room is just the way you left it.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: <em>sigh</em><br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br/> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br/>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br/>Player chose: I've played this before</p>

<p><hr/><p>Week 1</p><p>(Studied Composure in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Reflexes in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 2<br/><br/>(Studied Composure in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Reflexes in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br/>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br/>Player chose: Arrest her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are a traitor to the crown and I ought to have you executed.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: GUARDS! Arrest her!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Throw her into the castle dungeons and let her rot!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Well. I suppose she won't be a problem anymore.<br/> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br/><hr/>Week 3<br/><br/>(Studied Novan History in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Reflexes in the afternoon.)<br/> You may now play Sports on the weekends.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Me too.<br/> You gather your skirts and prepare to sit down, when all of a sudden, a hissing noise alerts you to a hidden danger - a snake!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Charlotte, don't move!<br/> With your quick reflexes, you grab a forked stick and manage to flip the snake away from you and your cousin.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: EEEEEK!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Get away, you horrible thing!<br/> You stomp loudly on the ground, and the snake slithers off into the distance.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What is going on out here?<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Mummy, there was a snake!<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What was a snake doing in the royal gardens? This is completely unacceptable. You could have been killed!<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Elodie scared it off.<br/>Lucille, Countess of Nix: That's not good enough. I can't have my daughter remaining in such a dangerous place! We are returning home to Merva at once.<br/>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Awww....<br/> You venture into the depths of the castle dungeons.<br/> The Duchess of Ursul is there, in her cell, sitting perfectly straight on the bench against the wall and looking your direction as if she'd been expecting you.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Caution is wise for one in your position. Hasty judgments can lead to trouble.<br/>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Are you ready to listen now?<br/>Menu: [Hear her out] [Taunt her] <br/>Player chose: Taunt her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Having fun in here? Are the rats being good company? Because you're <i>never</i> leaving.<br/> You flick your fingernail against the metal bars to remind her of her place.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br/> For a moment, the ground seemed to tremble. Was that an earthquake?<br/> You're not sure, but you think you'd rather not be in the dungeons right now.<br/><hr/>Week 4<br/><br/>(Studied Composure in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Novan History in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 5<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Herbs in the afternoon.)<br/> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br/>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We have a Duke of Sedna?<br/>Alice: ... No, my Lady. The duchy of Sedna is in Talasse.<br/>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It might not be appropriate for me to wear a man's gift in public, though. People would think it meant something.<br/>Menu: [Wear it] [Don't wear it] <br/>Player chose: Don't wear it<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's important to maintain the proper image.<br/> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 6<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the afternoon.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That woman, the priestess, keeps staring at me.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you want?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: Your destiny will find you, even if you run from it. You were born to wield the power of a Lumen.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you know about that?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The power was your mother's, and the kings and queens before her. It is your right and your responsibility to defend your domain.<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: I have seen signs of the future. Danger is coming. Without that power, this land is defenseless.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well... What am I supposed to do about it?<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: The Duchess of Ursul will teach you, if you set her free.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: But -<br/>Selene, Priestess of the Second Circle: She never harmed your mother. They were friends. It is only because she bears the power of a Lumen so openly that your father rejects her.<br/>Menu: [I will free her] [I won't free her] <br/>Player chose: I won't free her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is all a trick to get the traitor released. I won't listen to you!<br/> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br/><hr/>Week 7<br/><br/>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the afternoon.)<br/> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br/> You swiftly step aside and let her pass.<br/> You return to your rooms, but you have barely settled when someone knocks on the door.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A visiting noble wishes to speak with you.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: <em>sigh</em> Who is it?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke Consort of Mead.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (If I remember right, he's the brother of the Duchess of Ursul.)<br/> You follow your father downstairs to greet your guest.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: Your Highness. Thank you for meeting with me in this difficult time.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: I come to you on behalf of the people of Ursul, who have been left without a protector.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: Commoners require governance and leadership, or they fall into chaos.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You want me to free your sister the Duchess?<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: I wish for Ursul to have a leader. If my sister has displeased you, then I stand willing to serve.<br/>Ignatius, Duke Consort of Mead: If you prefer Julianna in that position, then yes, free her. It is, of course, your decision.<br/>Menu: [Free Duchess Julianna] [Give her title to Ignatius] <br/>Player chose: Give her title to Ignatius<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine, then. <b>You</b> can be Duke of Ursul.<br/>Ignatius, Duke of Ursul: On behalf of our people, I thank you for your wisdom.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Now I can leave Julianna locked up forever and no one will care!)<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 8<br/><br/>(Studied Novan History in the morning.)<br/>(Studied World History in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br/>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br/>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br/>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know much about factories or trade. Would that really be worthwhile?)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br/> You sneak out of the castle to have a little fun. You enjoy your freedom, but your father won't like it if he finds out.<br/><hr/>Week 9<br/><br/>(Studied Herbs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Battlefield Medicine in the afternoon.)<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I know there's been some problems with Ixion, but I don't know the details. I guess they're occupying southern Maree.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything about the military. I don't want to fight.)<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might say so, you are looking particularly lovely this day. I hope you will think fondly of me.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Is he flirting with me? He's almost as old as my father!)<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/><hr/>Week 10<br/><br/>(Studied Foreign Affairs in the morning.)<br/>(Studied World History in the afternoon.)<br/> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hellas and Maree are neighboring duchies. Together, the siblings Brin and Banion govern most of Southern Nova.)<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It was the Duchess of Hellas who tried to take over part of Ixion's territory, without the support of my mother the Queen.)<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br/>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br/>Player chose: Offer to punish the Duchess of Hellas<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: We appreciate that you feel wronged. One of our subjects attempted to instigate a rebellion in your territory.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: However, she did not have our approval for these actions. If you withdraw your troops, we will punish her.<br/>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Your Highness!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is the fair solution. You have no right to invade us because of her actions.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: What manner of punishment were you considering?<br/>Menu: [Make her a commoner] [Command her to marry an Ixionite] [Execute her] <br/>Player chose: Make her a commoner<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: She will be stripped of her titles and forced to live as one of the common people.<br/>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, I must protest!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: No one will be allowed to benefit from sneaky attempts at stealing land. Not Hellas and not Ixion. Nobody.<br/>Diplomat from Ixion: Very well. We will accept this apology.<br/>Brin: This is outrageous!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Out!<br/> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br/>(Put on the history outfit.)<br/><hr/>Week 11<br/><br/>(Studied Dance in the morning.)<br/>(Studied Herbs in the afternoon.)<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br/>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br/> You go down to the dungeons to taunt Julianna with her helplessness and lack of noble status.<br/> However, when you approach her cell, you find her sitting cross-legged with her eyes closed, paying absolutely no attention to you.<br/>Menu: [Taunt her anyway] [Execute her] [Leave her alone.] <br/>Player chose: Execute her<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: You think you can ignore me?<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: GUARDS!<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Go in there and get your swords ready.<br/>Elodie, Crown Princess: Cut her head off. Right now.<br/> Julianna's eyes snap open, staring at you. But it doesn't matter, because there's nothing she can do. She's a helpless prisoner.<br/> ... Right?<br/> What's that light heading towards you?<br/>Elodie did not survive to reach her coronation.  Nova would have to go on without her.</p></p>

<p>But it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!</p>
