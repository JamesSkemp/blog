<p>Since I've got a couple more days worth of tutorials already written, and since things are now going relatively smoothly (I had a couple of problems with the MySQL implementation as a whole), I figured I would give an update to what I've been doing, and what I will be doing.</p>
<p>Tonight, I'll be posting the tutorial on getting PHP up and running.&nbsp; Within a day, or maybe two, of doing that, I'll be walking through the installation of MySQL and phpMyAdmin.&nbsp; The next tutorial will cover MySQL Administrator (and will closely follow the previous posting).</p>
<p>The other tutorials haven't been written yet, but I'm looking at something like the following order: Zend, ColdFusion, WordPress, AWStats, MagpieRSS, and a content management system (PHP-based).&nbsp; The last two will probably be a number of days down the road, while certainly the first two, possibly three, will be by the end of next week.</p>
<p>Just an FYI, since I don't even have a very good table of contents for the tutorials I've been writing.&nbsp; However, I will post something on the main page of StrivingLife.net, or the like.</p>
<p>Also, I just ordered a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book, direct from Adobe Press (at 30% of retail, how can you go wrong?).&nbsp; That will probably result in me spending some time learning that, and working on doing some site modifications (such as adding the all-important image in my banner).</p>
<p>Of course, the problem is, now I've found a number of other books that I'd like to pick up at some point, and since I received two coupons for 35% off ... I guess there's no reason not to pick some more books up.</p>
<p>Just in case you want to donate to StrivingLife.net, the books I would pick up include (in something like this order):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adobepress.com/title/0321336283">Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 Certified Developer Study Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobepress.com/title/0321321839">Adobe Illustrator CS2 Classroom in a Book</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobepress.com/title/0321321855">Adobe InDesign CS2 Classroom in a Book</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobepress.com/title/0321294009">Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Classroom in a Book</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, after I read the Photoshop book, that might move the DW guide down a bit.&nbsp; I'm not looking for certification, per se, but it would be nice to know that I could get certified if I wanted to.&nbsp; (Honestly, I haven't spent any time looking, but it would be something nice to have on my resume, along with some certification in a programming language like PHP or CF.&nbsp; But, that's for another time, and once I stop trying to be a jack, and instead a professional.)</p>
