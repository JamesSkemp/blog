The following is a review of the Petstages Channel Scratcher Catnip Blasted Scratching Post Station for Cats, Large, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Did Nothing For Our Three Cats
We have three male cats at our home who love their cat tree, and scratching up the carpet. With our stairs having recently been relieved of their carpet, they're no longer able to attack a corner of one of the stairs up from the landing between the first and second floors.

We've talked about purchasing a cat tree for either the landing or for the top of the stairs on the second floor, so when the opportunity arose to try out the [Petstages Scratching Post][review] I took it.

The station is flat, with alternating rows of cardboard and sandpaper. It also supposedly was 'catnip blasted' but our cats are used to their grandma's homegrown catnip, so it didn't do anything for them, and I don't recall smelling it when we unpacked it. Construction of it seems fine, and it's a nice enough size, but maybe more of a medium in size.

It being flat made it a little difficult to prop up by itself, and it'll slide on flat floors, so it's definitely designed for the cat(s) to lay on it and scratch away. 

Sadly, our cats have simply ignored it after they got past the curiosity of there being something new in the house. We did try coaxing them on it, including putting the youngest (9-12 months old) on it and showing him he could scratch it, but it just didn't seem to appeal to them.

After putting some fresh homegrown on it they rubbed into it a bit, but only for the catnip and then went back to ignoring it.

Our cats definitely like to scratch, as evident by our cat tree and what happened to our stairs, and is happening at the top of the stairs, but for some reason they're not seeing this an outlet.

For these reasons I give the [Petstages Scratching Post][review] two of five stars. We'll continue keeping it around and moving it around, but I'd probably recommend either a cat tree or a more standard scratching post (cone) for anyone looking for something for their cats.
