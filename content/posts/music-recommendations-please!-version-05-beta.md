<p>While not necessarily a step forward from <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Music-Recommendations-Please!-045-beta-released.aspx">version 0.4.5 of Music Recommendations Please!</a>, version 0.5 is nonetheless a positive step. Consider this an idea-based release. As such, this application is in no way final (but might be more complete after this long weekend).</p>
<p><a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/MusicRecommendationsPlease_0.5.zip">Download Music Recommendations Please! version 0.5, beta</a>.</p>
<p>You can see a general idea of where I'd like to end up by reading my <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Music-application-idea.aspx">music application idea</a>.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://smallestdotnet.com/">.NET Framework 4</a> is required for this application.</p>
<p>Ideas, outside of the obvious ones (such as changing the window's title and icon; I know) appreciated.</p>
