<p>
The following is a high-level look at Log Parser&#39;s (version 2.2) SQL syntax. This does assume that you understand the specifics of each part, but for those that do not, this will be covered in a future tutorial. (This is more for my use.)&nbsp; <strong>Bolded</strong> elements are required for any valid query, whereas the other elements are optional. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	<strong>SELECT</strong><br />
	USING<br />
	INTO<br />
	<strong>FROM</strong><br />
	WHERE<br />
	GROUP BY<br />
	HAVING<br />
	ORDER BY 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, details about the specific parts, with&nbsp;real-world examples,&nbsp;will be covered in a future tutorial.
