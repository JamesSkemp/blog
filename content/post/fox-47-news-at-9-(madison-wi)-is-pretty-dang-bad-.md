<p>Normally I wouldn't waste my time writing on something like this, but after almost 30 minutes, I've just got to say it (hopefully it will get some other local voice to agree or disagree, or otherwise shed some additional light on this): Fox 47 News at 9 borders on horrid.<!--more--><!--adsense--></p>
<p>Ignore the fact that it's Fox News,</p>
<p>Ignore the fact that their weather man appears to be new on the job (he's probably not, but he's local-access material),</p>
<p>Ignore the fact that at multiple points in the broadcast either the sound or visual effects were off,</p>
<p>and the show wouldn't be that bad.</p>
<p>Yet, is it on par with NBC 15's regular news casts? I think not ...</p>
<p>So, Madisonians, did I just catch a really bad broadcast tonight?</p>
