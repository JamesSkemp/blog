So, the Isthmus picked up my post on Netflix.&nbsp; That&#39;s very nice of them (I wonder how it was picked up?).&nbsp; In the course of looking over the Isthmus&#39; site, I noticed another post title &quot;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.armadilloman.net/Blogger/2006/09/dear-city-of-madison.html">Dear City of Madison</a>&quot; Ouch. Reading his post first, and his profile second (which included his location), the title of this post came to mind.
</p>
<p>
Years ago, when both my sister and I were living at home, we&#39;d fight, as siblings under one roof and with only one TV, often do.&nbsp; Her time would be spent surfing around, from one channel to another.&nbsp; As we got older, and we were both able to drive, she took that habit with her to the car and the radio.&nbsp; (Thankfully, I&#39;m older, so I never picked up her horrid habits.)
</p>
<p>
Anywho, Rad&#39;s post reminded me of my sister, and what I told her many times, about surfing through radio stations.&nbsp; At first it was long, but as time passed, and my words had no impact on her, it shortened up.&nbsp; To sum, &quot;If you keep channel surfing, you&#39;re bound to keep running into commercials.&quot;&nbsp; Id est, you&#39;re bound to keep running up against crap.&nbsp; Sure, everyonce in a while you&#39;ll hit something good, but your chances of listening to the entire song are slim.&nbsp; Only by picking a station and sticking with it are you truly able to determine whether the station is any good.
</p>
<p>
In Madison WI, we have a radio station which is an excellent example of this, 105-1 Charlie FM &quot;We play everything&quot;.&nbsp; And indeed they do.&nbsp; 70s, 80s, 90s, today.&nbsp; Pop, rock, country, but (other than that one Aerosmith song) no rap that I know of ...&nbsp; Heck, sometimes there&#39;s crap that I don&#39;t want to listen to, but if you stick around until the end of the song, you&#39;ll get something else.
</p>
<p>
Do we have a lot of country stations?&nbsp; Yeah, yeah we do.&nbsp; But, what do you expect from an area that, although we live in city, we play in the country?&nbsp; I suppose that&#39;s one of the things that really separates us from the larger cities - the fact that we can spend a short time in the car and hit a lake or river, or a beautiful park, with trails.&nbsp; Citizens of Madison do not have to sit around their houses, watching TV, or drive from one mall to another, listening to the radio.&nbsp; We&#39;ve got much more we can do.
</p>
<p>
Are we missing a great jazz station?&nbsp; Perhaps.&nbsp; I know NPR/WPR plays jazz every once in a while, and perhaps Magic 98 still plays jazz on Sundays?&nbsp; (It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve listened to them.)&nbsp; There&#39;s at least a couple UW stations that also play a wide range of music, so I doubt there isn&#39;t some jazz play on one of them.
</p>
<p>
Of course, our stations also move around a lot as well.&nbsp; I think 98.1 and 104.1 are the only stations that haven&#39;t changed at least once since I&#39;ve lived in the Madison area (over 10 years).&nbsp; But we try new things, and we find a station that we like.&nbsp; And we don&#39;t listen to one station all the time.&nbsp; I&#39;ve six presets on my car&#39;s radio, and they are all different.&nbsp; There&#39;s two that I switch between a lot, but every once in a while I hit one of the others.&nbsp; We like change in Madison, we&#39;re progressive.
</p>
<p>
Another great thing we&#39;ve got is State St.&nbsp; On the weekend, there are few places as musically rich as State St.&nbsp; There&#39;s a great guy near the Capitol who plays one hell of a sax.&nbsp; On the opposite end, bands setup near the University Bookstore, and towards the middle there&#39;s a number of places for groups to setup and play.&nbsp; The various Unions, too, house many events.&nbsp; Sitting off the lake, on a hot summer evening, listening to the music ...&nbsp; Heck, concerts on the square.&nbsp; On a good day, head over to Potbellies and listen to the music while you eat.&nbsp; Heck, Madison WI is in a class by it&#39;s own.
</p>
<p>
Rad comments on two stations in his article: The Current (which appears to be MPR - or WPR here in Wisconsin, so we&#39;ve got that) and Drive 105 (which appears to be alternative, which we&#39;ve also had, and I&#39;m sure have still).&nbsp; To this, I answer, read the title of this post.&nbsp; One likes a station not based on their first impression, but on the impressions of many hours.&nbsp; You may stop and listen to a station if you stumble upon a song you enjoy, but you don&#39;t stay on a station after hearing that one song - it&#39;s a number of good songs that keeps bringing you back.
</p>
<p>
So, spend more time in Madison.&nbsp; Move to a station and stick with it.&nbsp; If you&#39;re down in Madison to see Madison-ians, then listen to the stations they listen to.&nbsp; You&#39;re bound to run into songs that you don&#39;t like, but that&#39;s the way it is ...&nbsp; Head downtown, and check out postings.&nbsp; There&#39;s bound to be a local group putting on a show that&#39;s in line with your tastes.
</p>
<p>
In short, do our stations suck?&nbsp; Sometimes, sure.&nbsp; But find a large city that doesn&#39;t have some, some of the time.&nbsp; Besides, we&#39;ve got a nice mix of stations, and a beautiful city that ensures we can find something to listen to.
