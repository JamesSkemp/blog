<h3>[14 Reincarnation]</h3>
<p>
(A room comes into view. We slowly zoom in to a mirror showing a girl sitting in a chair.) 
</p>
<p>
(Batou:) You&#39;re awake. 
</p>
<p>
Status report, please. And maybe an explanation about this body. 
</p>
<p>
I was in a hurry. It was all I could get on the black market. Not my taste, really. Section 9 arrived with help right after it happened. They took two cyborg bodies and a slightly beat-up Batou back home. That was about 20 hours ago. For diplomatic reasons, the whole case has been covered up. Section 9 reported it as a terrorist attack. In return, the Foreign Minister has resigned. Nakamura&#39;s being questioned. The whole thing ends in a draw. Only the whereabouts of the Major&#39;s brain shell remains a mystery. Okay with you? 
</p>
<p>
I like the decorating. This your safe house? 
</p>
<p>
My very own. You&#39;re the first person I ever brought here. If you want to... You can stay as long as you like. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks, but I&#39;d better go. 
</p>
<p>
Hey. What did you and he talk about? Is he still there, inside of you? 
</p>
<p>
Batou, do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night? Before those words we heard come these ones: &quot;When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot; Here before you is neither the program called the Puppet Master nor the woman that was called the Major. 
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll find a car key in the left pocket of that dress. Take one you like. The code on it is... 
</p>
<p>
...2501? Let&#39;s make that our password, for when we meet again. 
</p>
<p>
(Kusanagi is outside Batou&#39;s.) 
</p>
<p>
And where shall I go now? The net is vast and limitless.
