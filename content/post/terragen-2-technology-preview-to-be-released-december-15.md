Development on Planetside Software&#39;s Terragen&amp;trade; has been extremely slow in the last couple of years.&nbsp; While new versions and news were coming out at a semi-steady pace years ago, visible development dried up.<br />
<br />
All that changes on December 15 (possibly) with the release of the Terragen 2 Technology Preview.&nbsp; It&#39;s almost 7:30 CST, which means December 16 in a number of parts of the world, and there&#39;s no sign of the download yet.&nbsp; The fact that there&#39;s no mention of what time, makes me think that the Preview still needs/needed a few more touches before it was released.&nbsp; Or, they just want to do some load testing on their servers.&nbsp; Your call.<br />
