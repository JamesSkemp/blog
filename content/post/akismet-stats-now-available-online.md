<p>
Akismet, one great WordPress plugin if you&#39;ll be accepting public comments, now has made available global stats on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://akismet.com/stats/">http://akismet.com/stats/</a>.  What&#39;s scary is the amount of spam per &#39;ham&#39; (non-spam).<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also noticed a large increase in spam, which I attributed to leaving comments on some fairly popular blogs - with my main domain as a URL. However, since it&#39;s across the board, I guess I can&#39;t easily attribute it to that, yet.

<p>
I&#39;ve got 891 of those spam comments - just short of a round 900 ...

The question is, if Akismet cost $1 a month, how many people would still use it?  My guess?  Quite a lot.  There&#39;s other plugins out there, but Akismet (other than the fact that there isn&#39;t a a delete all button at the bottom of the page) is king in what it does.
