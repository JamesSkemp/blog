<p>
Quick review. I liked Cowboy Bebop, and I believe this was recommended from Amazon (for those who like Cowboy Bebop). Instead of purchasing the complete collection of Outlaw Star, I decided to try out one of the discs, containing the first five episodes, from Netflix.<!--more-->

<p>
Since I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop, I must say I enjoyed Outlaw Star in the same way. Both series appear to have a similar style, pace, and &#39;story&#39; (the stories aren&#39;t the same, but they contain some similar elements).
</p>
<p>
Overall, I think I&#39;d purchase the series to view the additional episodes of this series.
