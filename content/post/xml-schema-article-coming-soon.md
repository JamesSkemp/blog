<p>
The other day, after a deal of research, I decided to pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/" target="_blank">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>, which&nbsp;is &quot;a complete cross platform XML editor providing the tools for XML authoring, XML conversion, XML Schema, DTD, Relax NG and Schematron development, XPath, XSLT, XQuery debugging, SOAP and WSDL testing.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
This provided to be the key to finally understanding XML Schema, or at least getting a working Schema for an XML file. 
</p>
<p>
Since I&#39;ve covered <a href="/words/?tag=/xml">XML</a> in a couple of <a href="/words/category/tutorialsguides.aspx">tutorials/guides</a>, I&#39;ll be adding another covering using an XML Schema, in place of a DTD. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll have a &#39;full&#39; review of &lt;oXygen/&gt; once I&#39;ve played with it for a while. Thus far, I&#39;m fairly impressed with it. However, it runs on Java, and runs a bit slower than I would like/expect. However, this may just be an issue that I&#39;ll need to resolve by tweaking some of the settings.
</p>
<p>
The indent/format feature, however, blew me away the other day. Wow!
</p>
<p>
(If you&#39;re interested, there is a trial version available. Also, until the 15th of January, there&#39;s a sale on all versions.) 
</p>
<p>
An alternative that I looked at was Stylus Studio, however the extremely high price-point turned me away from even trying the trial version ...
