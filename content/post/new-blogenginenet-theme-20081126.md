<p>I've been working on a new theme for the site, since around 7 this evening ... and it's&nbsp;finally rolled out.</p>
<p>This is along the lines of what I was thinking a couple weeks ago, but I actually grabbed some ideas from Microsoft's recent KB changes.</p>
<p>This is the first theme I've created that used the widget functionality, and I can honestly say I'm still <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=33113" target="_blank">not that impressed</a> with it.</p>
<p>I still have to add some styles for coding that I add in, once I find a good sample (did I really just use blockquote?), and I'm sure I'll find something else that I missed, but ... it's pretty close.</p>
<p>This has also definitely made me realize how much I need to start posting issues to the BE.NET tracker again.</p>
