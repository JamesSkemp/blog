<p>
There&#39;s a handful of extensions for Firefox that I found absolutely necessary in my day-to-day Web production and development. Below, I&#39;ve outlined the essentials, as well as those that are near the top of the crop.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Please note that my current setup is Windows, with Firefox 1.5.0.2. After each extension, I&#39;ve listed the current version, at the time of this writing. I cannot speak for any versions before or after those listed.
</p>
<h4>1. Web Developer (version 1.0.2)</h4>
<p>
Interested in creating content on the Web? Without these extension, expect to spend more time than necessary tracking down bugs and flaws in layout, and so much more. Chris Pederick&#39;s extension is the only extension you really need to install - and without it, no Web producer&#39;s/developer&#39;s Firefox installation is complete.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<h4>2. HTML Validator (version 0.7.9)</h4>
<p>
If you&#39;re interested in valid code, than Marc&#39;s extension is an absolute must-have. If you&#39;re not, but you&#39;re a Web producer or developer, it&#39;s time to start getting interested. Install this extension and see what&#39;s going on, without having to check the W3C all the time.
</p>
<h4>3. The rest</h4>
<p>
Honestly, that&#39;s the only two extensions which are absolutely essential for a Web producer or developer. Anything other than these two are going to be specific to user preference.
</p>
<p>
For example, IE Tab (1.0.9) is pretty nice to use, but it&#39;s really not the essential. Live HTTP Headers (0.12) and Header Monitor (0.3.4) are also really nice extensions, but again not essential.
</p>
<p>
A9 SiteInfo (1.0) is for a niche audience, since the file necessary for this to work just isn&#39;t implemented that often.
</p>
<p>
Attention Recorder (0.64) have great potential, but until I can start seeing my data, it&#39;s only taking hard drive space.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard raves about Greasemonkey, but have yet to really work with it. Part of me hates to install it, because I&#39;m not too big on the idea of fixing other people&#39;s problems. If I visit a site that&#39;s got major problems, I&#39;m going to send an email to the Webmaster, not fix it if I find the site useful. Likewise, I&#39;m going to block ads, as I use them, and know that they bring in a bit of change. If you can make $100 a year, you&#39;ve got a good host paid for for that span of time ...
</p>

<p>
Of course, there&#39;s plenty of extensions out there, that I haven&#39;t tried (and a number I&#39;ve tried but removed because they just weren&#39;t getting used). So, if you think you&#39;re using an extension that an essential, leave a comment and let me know what you&#39;re using, and why it&#39;s an essential.
