<p>
On this site, I have a number of articles discussing how to setup ColdFusion MX, both <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/02/27/58/installing-coldfusion-on-a-local-windows-based-apache-server/">version 6.1</a> and <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Upgrading-our-installation-of-ColdFusion-MX-701-on-a-local-Windows-based%2c-Apache%2c-server.aspx">version 7.0</a>. These tutorials will get you up and running on your own computer, but there&#39;s no information on how to continue on to a real, live, host.<!--more-->

A couple of years ago, it was possible, it seems, to get free ColdFusion hosting. Of course, you had to show some advertising, I&#39;m sure, but nonetheless ...
</p>
<p>
A short while ago, say a year, I found out about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cfdeveloper.co.uk">CFDeveloper</a> which offers ColdFusion hosting for both a recurring charge, as well as one flat, and low, fee.
</p>
<p>
The one-time charge will give you 10 MB of disk space, and 500 MB of bandwidth, with one Access database available.
</p>
<p>
(Sorry, no MySQL databases with this account, as silly as that may seem. I suppose having an Access database means less upkeep, since MySQL is updated on a much more regular basis.)
</p>
<p>
I setup an account and you can see my site (currently without projects) at <a href="http://www.strivinglife.cfdeveloper.co.uk/">http://www.strivinglife.cfdeveloper.co.uk/</a>. Less than $5, for ever (so long as I keep active every 30 days), and I have a free account, that only requires the one advertisement (which I can place where I want, so it seems).
</p>
<p>
While this will not take the place of a real host, it&#39;s a great way to get a free, live, development server, so you can test your own code on another box, or share code with others.
</p>
<p>
Know of another host that charges a small fee for setting up a development server? Let me know by posting a comment below.
