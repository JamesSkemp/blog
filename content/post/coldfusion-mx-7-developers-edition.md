<p>
So. I took the next step and downloaded, and installed, ColdFusion MX 7.01, Developer&#39;s Edition, on my home computer.  (I also picked up another 512 MB of memory from Crucial.com, but that&#39;s another story.)<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Why?  Well, I needed the memory for the programs I&#39;m using.  Why ColdFusion?  Because I&#39;m using it at work anyways, and the Developer Edition is free.  When presented with that, why not?  Sure, I&#39;ve got Apache running on the same machine, and I can already program in so many languages, but I&#39;d really like to be able to write CF code for ... fun.  Yikes.  Seriously, it&#39;s an interesting, and fun, language.
</p>
<p>
Can CF do lots of unique things that other languages can&#39;t do?  Maybe - I don&#39;t know.  But I do know that I&#39;ve got to use it, so use it I will.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you won&#39;t see CF used on the StrivingLife.net Network, since I&#39;m sure iPowerWeb won&#39;t be purchasing and installing ColdFusion - why bother, and would it even run on BSD?  But, you may see snippets of code floating about.  And heck, if I can find a way to run ASP for nothing, maybe I&#39;ll add that to my machine as well.  Since I want to pick up another computer anyways, why not?
