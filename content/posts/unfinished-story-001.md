<p>
But the thing of it is, is that you cannot possibly know what that is like.
</p>
<p>
But I don&#39;t need to try it in order to know that I am not going to like it. It&#39;s something that I know, something that I will always know. I mean, you were told by your friends what it would be like, but I don&#39;t have that, I don&#39;t have friends that I could get that information from.
</p>
<p>
So just because you didn&#39;t have friends you didn&#39;t try it? You do to have friends.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
You do. Everyone has friends...
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t. What is a friend, eh? Someone that you can count on?
</p>
<p>
Sure.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t count on people. People care about themselves
</p>
<p>
Sure they do, but that&#39;s how people are. But that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t care about others too.
</p>
<p>
If you care about yourself... Look, you never know with other people. Never. I mean, you can&#39;t even know about me. I could be a completely different person then I let on. I mean, I could like to skin cats or something.
</p>
<p>
But you don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
But, if under the right circumstances, perhaps I would.
</p>
<p>
What? You aren&#39;t making sense.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say that I didn&#39;t know some of the people I did... Well,
</p>
