This is a review for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR18M/strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Kong Cat ZoomGroom</a>, which is a very nice brush. A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Groom-For-Dogs-Raspberry/dp/B0002Y1RCE/tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">similar product is available for dogs</a>.

I picked up one of these for my cat, who doesn&#39;t much care to be held, have her nails cut, etcetera. However, she loves this &#39;brush.&#39; 
</p>
<p>
Not only goes this magically work loose the hair, but it seems to give a good massage, and does a fairly good job of keeping the loose hair on the brush. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve since purchased another of these, for a gift for my sister&#39;s cat (who seems to shed whenever he throws his massive bulk around) and two of the Zoom Groom For Dogs for two cockers my mother owns. 
</p>
<p>
In all cases, they&#39;ve worked wonders. 
</p>
<p>
However, I have found that this brush is not as easy to handle as the one that is available for dogs. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, I can&#39;t recommend this product enough; Kong sure knows how to make their products.
