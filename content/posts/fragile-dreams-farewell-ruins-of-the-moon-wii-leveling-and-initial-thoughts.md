<p>A little over an hour into <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002E6XY6U?tag=strivinglifen-20">Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon</a> I have three levels of information, and some preliminary thoughts.</p>
<h3>Leveling information</h3>
<p>I'll put this into an XML file at some point, I'm sure, but here are the first three levels.</p>
<p>Level - HP - Base Attack - Experience to next level</p>
<p>1 - 100 - 4 - 1000<br />2 - 120 - 6 - 3000<br />3 - 140 - 8 - 6775</p>
<p>I've died once so far, when the third enemy I ran into (see also below) 'snuck' up on me.</p>
<p>Blue ghosts give 100 points of experience, and seem to come back very frequently, so I was tempted to grind out a couple of levels on them. Just left the Subway, and it sounds like I'll probably be going back there soon, so perhaps I will.</p>
<h3>Initial thoughts</h3>
<p>First, I have a basic Wii remote, so a newer model may work better. But what I've found is that the pointer frequently gets lost, resulting in camera spin and disorientation. Since it was third-person, I thought I wouldn't be impacted by the game, but my stomach and head haven't been feeling too hot (although I do think I'm still fighting something off, and the darkness of the game and weakness of the intial flashlight doesn't help).</p>
<p>The third enemy you run into (the small blue ghosts being what I consider the second) are pretty freaky, reminding me of something I'd see in Persona, or a SMT game.</p>
<p>It's early, but the story already seems&nbsp;a little odd. You follow someone into a Subway and while you can't find them, there's also no way they could have gone anywhere, since every exit but the one you came in is locked ...</p>
<p>It's much too early, though, for any real decisions about the game.</p>
<p>Published by XSEED Games, though, and something I was looking forward to when it was still questionable whether it was coming over to the States, so ...</p>
