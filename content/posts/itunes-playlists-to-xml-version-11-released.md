<p>Version 1.1 of iTunes Playlists to Xml has been released.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_1.1.zip">Download iTunes Playlists to Xml version 1.1</a>.</p>
<p>This update now appends the saved xml file with the current date and time, for ease. I debated also including the source and playlist names, but the amount of space that might use was limiting, so I just used the date/time instead.</p>
<p>I've also gone back to <em>not</em> using an installer. You can once again just extract the contents of the zip file, where you'd like, and run the executable.</p>
<p>Application still requires the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Comments/suggestions welcome.</p>
