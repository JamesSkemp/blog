Description: Script of the movie <em>Waking Life</em>, based on Tara Carreon&#39;s transcription, but with revisions based upon a viewing of the DVD version of the movie, which was watched with subtitles. 
</p>
<p>
Notes: Special thanks to Andrew, Larry Redden, and Ed Sandberg for pointing out errors in Tara&#39;s transcription (numerous errors were fixed here, along with some scene information clarifications). Absolutely let me know if anything slipped by my look-over, especially in the quicker and the &#39;like, like, you know,&#39; sections ;)
