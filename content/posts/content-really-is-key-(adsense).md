<p>
I&#39;ve just updated The Framing Business to work with WordPress. While doing so, I decided to take a close look at just how AdSense is working on that site, compared to just this blog. What I found was actually quite surprising.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
First, The Framing Business (FB) has earned a couple pennies less than one of the channels I setup for this blog. So, dollars are pretty comparable.
</p>
<p>
Second, click through rates are fairly equal as well. FB is 0.05% lower than the one channel for this site.
</p>
<p>
Third, clicks are higher for FB than this one site channel (almost three times).
</p>
<p>
However, page impressions are over four times as high. Also, this one channel has been in play for a couple of months - significantly less than the single ads on the bottom of The Framing Business pages. Which means?
</p>
<p>
Content is king. Back when I started I was making zilch, and while I&#39;m still not making much, I&#39;m at least bringing in a steady trickle.
</p>
<p>
Why? Because I started writing about technology. Because I moved my old articles out of PDF and into HTML content (that I could then attach an ad to). I&#39;m still writing great content, I&#39;m just learning to make it open to a wider audience (non-PDF files), with better ad format(s), and I&#39;m writing more often (although, unfortunately, shorter content).
</p>
<p>
Just an observation I had recently that I thought I would share.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to AdSense, content is king. However, while you hear it all the time, you don&#39;t realize just how true it is until you see actual numbers.
