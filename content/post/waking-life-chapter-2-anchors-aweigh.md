There&#39;s a girl there, and he sees her.) 
</p>
<p>
Hey man, it&#39;s me. Um, I just got back into town. I thought maybe I could bum a ride off you or something, but that&#39;s cool. I could probably just take a cab, something like that. Um -- Yeah, I guess I&#39;ll hang out with you later, something like that.

(A boat car drives up in front of the airport) 
</p>
<p>
Ahoy there matey! You in for the long haul? You need a little hitch in your get-along, a little lift on down the line? 
</p>
<p>
Oh, um, yeah, actually, I was waiting for a cab or something, but if you want to ... 
</p>
<p>
All right. Don&#39;t miss the boat. 
</p>
<p>
(He gets in.) Hey, thanks. 
</p>
<p>
Not a problem. Anchors aweigh!

So what do you think of my little vessel? She&#39;s what we call &quot;see-worthy.&quot; S-E-E. See with your eyes. I feel like my transport should be an extension of my personality. Voila. And this? This is like my little window to the world, and every minute it&#39;s a different show. Now, I may not understand it. I may not even necessarily agree with it. But I&#39;ll tell you what, I accept it and just sort of glide along. You want to keep things on an even keel I guess is what I&#39;m saying. You want to go with the flow. The sea refuses no river. The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving. Saves on introductions and good-byes. The ride does not require an explanation. Just occupants. That&#39;s where you guys come in. It&#39;s like you come onto this planet with a crayon box. Now, you may get the 8-pack, you may get the 16-pack. But it&#39;s all in what you do with the crayons, the colors that you&#39;re given. And don&#39;t worry about drawing within the lines or coloring outside the lines. I say color outside the lines. You know what I mean? Color right off the page. Don&#39;t box me in. We&#39;re in motion to the ocean. We are not landlocked, I&#39;ll tell ya that. So where do you want out? 
</p>
<p>
Uh, who, me? Am I first? Um, I don&#39;t know. Really, anywhere is fine. 
</p>
<p>
Well, just -- just give me an address or something, okay? 
</p>
<p>
Uh --

</p>
<p>
Where&#39;s that? 
</p>
<p>
Well I don&#39;t know either, but it&#39;s somewhere, and it&#39;s going to determine the course of the rest of your life. All ashore that&#39;s going ashore. Ha ha ha ha ha. Toot, toot.
