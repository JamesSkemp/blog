<h3>AmazonBasics: When price and quality matters</h3>
<p>While a number of retailers will try to sell you expensive cables, I've personally found Amazon's AmazonBasics line to be exactly what's needed, at an even better than expected price.</p>
<p>This isn't the first HDMI cable I've received in the AmazonBasics line, but I don't believe my previous cable supported 'ethernet, 3D, and audio return' like this one promises. Unfortunately (only for the sake of this review), I don't have a 3D television. Nor does my TV support ethernet. However, the quality of the cable is exactly as I expected.</p>
<p>I used this cable with both a Roku and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VUO6LU?tag=strivinglifen-20">PlayStation 3</a> slim, with a 26-inch LG television. I experienced absolutely no quality issues when using this cable.</p>
<p>One thing to note about this particular cable is that it's rather thick. This did cause issues for a bit as my PlayStation 3 sat close to the wall. Because of the cable's thickness it resisted the bending required, but after a slight change to my setup I experienced no further issues.&nbsp;Note also that this doesn't detract from the product itself, but is worth noting.</p>
<p>I've been purchasing <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_electronics?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin=AmazonBasics&amp;node=172282&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20">AmazonBasics USB and HDMI cables</a>, and still have no reason to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Highly recommended for both price and quality. 5 of 5 stars.</p>
