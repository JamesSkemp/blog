[8 The Store]
</p>
<p>
(Note: One of the coolest scenes in the movie.)
</p>
<p>
(Batou walks into the store, and heads towards the back.)
</p>
<p>
(A voice in his head.) &quot;You&#39;re in the kill zone.&quot;
</p>

</p>
<p>
&quot;Don&#39;t tamper with the settings on that new arm of yours. The operating system upgrades can conflict with the weapon-control, rendering it entirely useless.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Then you&#39;ll just have to reformat the thing. Hey, where are the remains of my old arm?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it. Not much left. The organic components in this one match your DNA.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I suppose that, with enough use, it&#39;ll feel like my own.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Ouch. Hey, just hold on.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The fact that you carried him here means that ...&quot;<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yeah. I broke into your little love nest. I just couldn&#39;t stomach the thought of him moaning with hunger, covered in shit, waiting for you. Believe it or not, I&#39;m a dog lover.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But I&#39;m the one that took him in for the night. My daughter&#39;s in heaven and my wife&#39;s fuming over her dirty carpets.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;When did you start tailing me?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s no big deal, man.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yes, it is a big deal. You used me as a smokescreen.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;If you had more experience, you would&#39;ve caught on. Blame it on the boss.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Is this pooch a clone? Aren&#39;t originals outrageously expensive?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;His was the first line bred by artificial insemination.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;It&#39;s hardly your style to let them hack into your brain. And any daily routine just makes you vulnerable to traps. I told you to stick to dry food.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But he likes the fresh stuff and that&#39;s the only store that carries it.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;They had you going berserk, shooting five bullets into your own arm, and nearly blowing away the storeowner.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;He may be nuts, but it&#39;s a rare bird that can hack into this guy. Except for the Major.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;And why didn&#39;t they make me blow my head off?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;I think because they want to disgrace you, not wipe you out. First, you barge into a yakuza office, send a dozen men to heaven or the hospital, and that very same day, unload your weapon in a grocery store. So we think either you&#39;ve gone mad or your e-brain&#39;s shot.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;But this was a planned attack. It proves that our case wasn&#39;t random.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;We can&#39;t pull out. We&#39;d jeopardize the whole point of Section 9.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;That&#39;s what the Major&#39;d say. And I&#39;ve got a message from the boss, too. Stay on it, but no more official Section support until you come up with material proof.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;We&#39;ll go to the source then, Locus Solus.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Nothing preserves secrecy like speed. You&#39;re going to the northern frontier immediately.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Far north?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;You two can&#39;t handle it?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Sure, but what about the basset?&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;The idea of a single man in this line of work keeping a dog is preposterous! And of all dogs, you choose a high-maintenance hound. It&#39;s not my problem. You guys figure it out!&quot;
