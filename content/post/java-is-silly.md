<p>
My main computer is, once again, horribly low on free space. Running through my installed programs, I once again see the wonders of installing Java. 
</p>
<p>
Multiple versions of 1.4, 5, and 6. 
</p>
<p>
Checking my new Vista machine, I have Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 6 Update 1, but not the Java(TM) 6 Update 5 that my XP Home has. Are these really the same? Yes, yes they are (thanks for sticking with not only one versioning chain, but also one name, Sun). 
</p>
<p>
So, I manually run the Java checker on my Vista machine, which says I&#39;m up-to-date. However, checking the Sun site, I&#39;m told that I&#39;m not. Surprise surprise, I end up getting a Java(TM) 6 Update 5 entry on my Vista machine. 
</p>
<p>
(FYI, Vista Home Premium, by default, doesn&#39;t have Java 1.4 or 5 installed.) 
</p>
<p>
Anyways, having cleaned off older installs (but keeping one version of 1.4 and 5) I gained at least a GB of space. 
</p>
<p>
I understand why they keep the older versions, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nice, but give us the option/warning to uninstall the older versions, eh? 
</p>
