<p>
It seems the XML Validation service is down/unavailable/what-have-you, and many of the other XML validators just don&#39;t seem to work.

I&#39;ve got my XML file - <a href="http://jamesrskemp.net/vehicle_gas.xml" target="_blank">http://jamesrskemp.net/vehicle_gas.xml</a> - validating with a DTD, but my attempts at getting a schema to work failed pretty hard ...
