<p>
I don&#39;t typically keep track of sports, but since Kirby Puckett was one of my favourite sport&#39;s people when I was younger, I have to at least mention his passing.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s funny, but now that I bought rabbit ears for the TV, I&#39;ve been actually getting more news than I was before.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and in some ways fortunately, the numbers I&#39;m hearing from the news are quite high.&nbsp; As in over 60% of troops in Iraq want out of Iraq, over 60% don&#39;t have confidence in Bush, and over 60% think civil war in Iraq is likely.

On another note, I&#39;m listening/watching ABC News, and they just had a brief interview with Kathleen Troia &quot;KT&quot; McFarland, who&#39;s running against Clinton for the New York senate. You could easily tell that there&#39;s bias from each individual involved, but something she said made me sit up.

<p>
During Lent, doesn&#39;t one typically give up the thing that they feel would be the best for them? That is, when I was little, I would give up chewing my nails (and fail) because it was the one thing I &lsquo;wanted&#39; to change (as a kid would). McFarland said she gave up making bad comments about people, or something to that effect, for Lent.

She was obviously dodging the bias charged question that she had been asked, but, nonetheless, I&#39;m not sure it was the best reply.
