<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of Shadowrun Returns (2013), available for PC on Steam.</p></div>

<h3>Enjoyable story and gameplay</h3>

<p>After having the game for a little over 9 months, I've finally beaten the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch, of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/">Shadowrun Returns</a> (2013).</p>

<p>It didn't take this long to beat it because the game wasn't enjoyable, but rather because the machine I had until a few months ago wasn't ideal for gaming, so it wasn't until the last three months that I really got into this.</p>

<p>The game itself has a robust story, as one would hope from a Shadowrun game. The game isn't particularly difficult, as I found myself only losing two characters over the course of the ~11 hours of time I put in</p>

<p>With a robust editor and community, I expect I'll be able to come back to Shadowrun Returns again and again over the years, for continued enjoyment.</p>

<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/">Shadowrun Returns</a>, and give it a 5 of 5 stars.</p>
