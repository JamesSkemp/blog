The following is a review of [Radiance LED String Lights, 5 ft, Silver Wire, Warm White, Battery Powered (2 Pack)][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Bright and Flexible

The first thing to note about these lights is that they consist of a wire between the lights, meaning they're easy to bend into place. The lights themselves are additionally pretty bright, with 15 lights on each 'string.' The lights are a part of the light, which means they don't stick out too far.

However, one concern with these lights is that despite being marketed for indoor and outdoor use, the battery case for one of the lights wouldn't completely close, suggesting that the elements may be able to get in and cause power issues. It almost looks like two screws are missing to keep it fully closed.

The power switch is a little iffy, but ultimately seems to work well enough.

For these reasons, I give [Radiance LED String Lights, 5 ft, Silver Wire, Warm White, Battery Powered (2 Pack)][review] four of five stars, and ultimately recommended.
