<h3>Every home should have one&nbsp; </h3>
<p>
I purchased an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z80ICM?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">APC Back-UPS ES 750 (BE750G)</a> on May 10, 2008. Since I had a blackout on 6/27, I figured I could finally write a review. 
</p>
<p>
First, this is my first APC, as well as my first battery backup, product. I&#39;ve owned a number of surge protectors in the past, but since I had purchased a new computer, I wanted to try a backup device. 
</p>
<p>
After a deal of research, I finally went with this one, after the value for the money, and the positive reviews APC had received. 
</p>
<p>
This model offers 10 outlets, of which 5 can run off of the battery. This also offers a master, and three &#39;slave&#39; outlets. This means that if the master is off, the three outlets can optionally be shut off as well (helpful for printers, monitors, speakers, ...) It&#39;s optional, so you can shut it off (which I did). 
</p>
<p>
It also offers a USB connection, so you can monitor the status of the battery using APC PowerChute Personal Edition. 
</p>
<p>
Along with charge percentage, it gives the number of volts being passed into it, and the watt load on the battery, which seems to translate into a battery estimate (how long equipment can run). 
</p>
<p>
PowerChute offers a couple of options, for when the power goes off - preserve the battery, or keep the computer on for as long as possible. 
</p>
<p>
Having had a blackout, albeit at night, I can suggest what I had happen. First, my computer appears to have been put to sleep. When it started back up, SpeedFan began running my two fans at 100%. In short, the battery handled the blackout perfectly. 
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re worried about alarms going off at night, there are settings to disable the alarm between particular hours, or disable it entirely. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, while this comes with a battery, they do recommend you replace these every three years. You can run self-tests manually to verify the battery. I did have a bit of trouble when first hooking up the battery, but it was relatively minor. 
</p>
<p>
(As a guy who&#39;s interested in statistics, I would also have liked to have been able to pull more information from PowerChute - for example, via a battery log of what&#39;s happening when I&#39;m not at my computer. Granted, it&#39;ll tell you when the battery kicks in, but I&#39;d like to know what voltage is being passed, and whether usage watts are spiking or moving throughout the day. What happens when I&#39;m running tasks, or if I have my computer sit for a couple of hours with the monitor off?) 
</p>

<p>
Overall, I&#39;m *extremely* happy with this product, and will *definitely* be purchasing another one of these to hook up my Playstation 3 and Sony Bravia.
