If you want a greatly in-depth look at this information, I suggest you visit the site above (Fourth Dimension: Tetraspace) since it is updated on a much more regular basis then this page :) When you begin to learn about numbers, you learn that they are situated upon a number line.</div>

I&#39;d tell someone, and I&#39;d only end up with pain, a blistering pain. I have chunks missing, each time, I have less on the scale.

  <div class="body">In this paper, I will be discussing the points that Antony Flew contributes to the debate on whether religious claims must be proven by empirical means in order to be factually meaningful. First, I will discuss Flew&rsquo;s major contribution, which is the analogy of the gardener. Second, I will discuss why this analogy helps to show that religious claims make no assertions, and are instead mere utterances. Flew begins his piece with a parable.</div>

  <div class="body">The following was written from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002, but I am just now (January 30, 2009) getting around to posting this. I can honestly admit that I haven&#39;t read over this in a very long time, but the skimming that I have done reminds me of certain things ... As time progresses I may go back and re-purpose this content. (Of particular note, also, will be at what time these were written and when I was reading certain philosophical works.) One has to question many of the things that many people take as being commonplace, or common knowledge.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">During the period of Romanticism, art and literature was attempting to get back to, and raise interest in, the natural. With more people in cities, as well as the effects of Industrialization, many were feeling that man was moving too fast. For this paper, I am going to talk about man&#39;s quest for dominance over nature, with particular interest in Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein. Throughout history, man has been trying to become a controller of nature.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">Descartes&rsquo; rationalist notion of necessary and contingent connections between simple natures has an important role in his Meditations. This, in turn, has an impact on other philosophers to come, in relation to the problems that the Meditations raise. This paper will first deal with simple natures, their connections, and their role in Descartes&rsquo; Meditations. After looking at Descartes, three other philosophers will be looked at to see how they deal with the ideas brought up by Descartes.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">What is the impact that civilization and its laws have on the individual? Particularly in the case of values and morality, does civilization help define one's values, or does it subvert them, leaving behind only those values that it can use in order to survive and converting those it can not? For this paper, I would like to look at Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and show how Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents is related to this story.</div>

  <div class="body">For this paper, I would like to focus on the topic of conflict and the ruler from the view of Confucianism.&nbsp;Specifically, I would like to look on how a ruler should operate, and under what conditions conflict, or war, should occur.&nbsp;By looking at the Analects, the Book of Mencius, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Great Learning, I hope to gain some insight into the relationship between these two subjects.</div>
