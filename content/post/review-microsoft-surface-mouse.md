The following is a review of the Microsoft Surface Mouse, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Nice Mouse, But I'll Stick With My Logitechs

The [Surface Pro 4][surface-pro], by itself or combined with a [Type Cover][type-cover], is already pretty sufficiently covered when it comes to a pointer device.

However, since I already had some with my old laptop, I ended up using a [Logitech M310][m310], putting the wireless dongle in the USB port. This has worked quite well for my purposes, with the Logitech mouse providing greater control when I was at a desk.

However, when I got the opportunity to try out the [Microsoft Surface Mouse][review] I decided to see how well it faired as an alternative.

The Surface Mouse looks quite nice, and combined with the [Microsoft Surface Keyboard][surface-keyboard] you have two very slick looking devices.

However, unlike the Keyboard the Mouse just didn't feel right in my hand. Like the keyboard I'm sure they took some design inspiration from Apple's versions, but for usability I'd rather use a mouse that was sculpted for the human hand. Compared to the Logitech M310, the Surface Mouse just feels too small and smooth. The scroll wheel too is just too small and smooth.

However, the Mouse worked out-of-the-box, quickly, once I had pulled out the battery tab. It also features a power button on the underside, a welcome addition.

However, I wouldn't carry around the Surface Mouse in my laptop bag, like I would with my Logitech. Not that the Surface Mouse doesn't seem well built, but because I wouldn't want to risk it, and the Logitech just seems more rugged.

Ultimately I'll be keeping my [Logitech M310][m310] in my laptop bag for remote use, and sticking with the [Microsoft Surface Mouse][review] when I'm at home, sitting at a desk. But, even then, I might just stick with my Logitech. For these reasons, I give the Microsoft Surface Mouse three of five stars.
