<ol>
	<li>... but you&#39;ve been here, all day, with that stupid grin on your face. And you don&#39;t even respond when I talk to you... I just need some kind of discussion, some show that you are alive, and aren&#39;t merely some mirage.</li>
	<li>I&#39;ve been walking around, how can you say I&#39;m not alive?</li>
	<li>You walk, and you walk, and you sit, and you... and you just have that dumb stupid grin on your face.</li>
	<li>What&#39;s this really about?</li>
	<li>That grin, I don&#39;t like it.</li>
	<li>You used to like it.</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t anymore.</li>
	<li>Why?</li>
	<li>Why.</li>
	<li>I want to know.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t do this, you know why.</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t, really, please, tell me.</li>
	<li>You know perfectly well why I don&#39;t like that stupid grin.</li>
	<li>It makes me look stupid.</li>
	<li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
	<li>Oh.</li>
	<li>Oh.</li>
	<li>Yeah, oh.</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t like it.</li>
	<li>Sorry.</li>
	<li>Then don&#39;t grin.</li>
	<li>Okay.&nbsp; I&#39;ll lose the grin.</li>
	<li>And don&#39;t start pouting either...</li>
	<li>So, don&#39;t grin, and don&#39;t frown?</li>
	<li>You know that&#39;s not what I mean.</li>
	<li>But that&#39;s what you said.</li>
	<li>No, yes, but that&#39;s not what I meant - no, I didn&#39;t say that at all, don&#39;t tell me that I did.</li>
	<li>...</li>
