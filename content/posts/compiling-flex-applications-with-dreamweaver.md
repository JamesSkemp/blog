Tom Lee wrote a post in July detailing how to compile and run Flex applications using Dreamweaver.  Since Flex 2 is making me very excited, I felt it was post worthy (especially since I won&#39;t have to do a Google search to get back to his post now).<!--more-->

<a href="http://tom-lee.blogspot.com/2006/07/edit-and-compile-flex-apps-in.html">Edit and Compile Flex Apps in Dreamweaver</a> details how to not only install Flex, but also how to easily, with the press of a button, compile Flex files using Dreamweaver and a couple of files.  Very cool stuff.

Since I&#39;m having a heck of a time getting Flex 1.5 so I can setup Eclipse to create/edit Flex, I&#39;m glad I found this post.  If only Adobe would link to this post as well.  I can see why they want to push Flex Builder to developers, since they&#39;re providing the Flex SDK free of charge, but still, the nice thing to do would point out that you can still get limited functionality with Dreamweaver ...

As for Flex, I need to goof off with creating some of the sample apps before I do what I want to do - namely switch some of my downloadable programs into Flex apps :D
