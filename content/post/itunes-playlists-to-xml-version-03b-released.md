<div class="warning">
<p>This application has since been updated. <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Having <a href="/words/post/iTunes-Playlists-to-Xml-version-02b-released.aspx">just released version 0.2b of iTunes Playlists to Xml</a>, I've done some updates, bringing it up to version 0.3b.</p>
<p>This release fixes all of the known issues, from version 0.2b.</p>
<p><em>There are no known issues with version 0.3b.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_0.3b.zip">Download iTunes Playlists to Xml - version 0.3b</a>.</p>
<p>iTunes Playlists to Xml requires .NET Framework 2.0 or higher, and has been tested on Windows XP&nbsp;Home SP3, and Windows Vista Ultimate SP1.</p>
<p>I've created an XSLT, <a href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xslt/iTunesPlaylists2Xml.xslt">available online separately</a>, that you can either use, as-is or after modification, to display your playlists on your own site.</p>
<p>This release offers some customization,&nbsp;used by&nbsp;the XSLT, but a future version should include the ability to select the fields you want output. A schema against which to validate&nbsp;should also be contained in the next release.</p>
<p>Comments are extremely welcomed.</p>
