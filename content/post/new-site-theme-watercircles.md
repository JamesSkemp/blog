<p>Based on <a href="http://www.opendesigns.org/design/?template=2382">metamorph_watercircles</a>, and converted for use with BlogEngine.NET, watercircles is now in use on my site.</p>
<p>The theme has a deal of special inline modifications for my own particular purposes, so it's not generally available for BlogEngine.NET users, but if you're interested ...</p>
<p>Comments welcome. (I'm sure I'll find things I missed as the weeks go by, but any findings are appreciated.)</p>
