<h3>[6 Simultaneous Reality &amp; Fantasy]</h3>
<p>
(We see the garbage man from before, who was making the calls. He looks dazed.) 
</p>
<p>
What do you mean, a &quot;virtual experience?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
I mean your wife, your daughter, the divorce, the affair, they&#39;re all fake memories. Like a dream. Someone was using you to ghost-hack a government official. 
</p>
<p>
No... That&#39;s impossible! 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been to your apartment. 
</p>
<p>
No one&#39;s there. It&#39;s a one-room apartment. 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I moved there when we split up-- 
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve been living there for ten years! 
</p>
<p>
You have no wife, no child. Your family exists only in your mind. 
</p>
<p>
Look. This is the picture you showed to your partner. Who is it of? 
</p>
<p>
But, she was there. My daughter... Smiling like an angel... 
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s your daughter&#39;s name? Where did you meet your wife, and when? How many years ago did you get married? Who do you see in the picture? 
</p>
<p>
How do I get rid of these fake memories? 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry. With our current technology... There&#39;ve been two successful deprogrammings but I can&#39;t recommend it to you. I&#39;m really sorry. 
</p>
<p>
Virtual experiences, dreams... All data that exists is both reality and fantasy. Whichever it is, the data a person collects in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole.
