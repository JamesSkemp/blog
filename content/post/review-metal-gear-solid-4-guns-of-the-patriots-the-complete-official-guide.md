The following review is for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761559698?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">The Complete Official Guide of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a>.

<p>
The short story: If you&#39;re new to MG, BUY THIS BOOK. If you want to completely* understand this game, BUY THIS BOOK. If you want to have a book that you can be glad you spent every penny for, BUY THIS BOOK. :D 
</p>
<p>
MGS4 is my first experience with the entire Metal Gear &#39;saga.&#39; Since MG has such a complicated storyline, my first playthrough involved a whole lot of listening to the cut scenes. 
</p>
<p>
However, despite all that, I was still a bit lost. 
</p>
<p>
Not only does this guide cover 99%* of the game, but it also contains a very readable synopsis of the entire story. (WARNING: Be careful if you read it before you&#39;ve finished MGS4. You can get away with reading a lot, but ...) This is what really made this book worth it, to me. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, the rest of the book helped a great deal as well, and is what I&#39;ll be consulting during my future runs through the game (one of which started the day after I completed MGS4). 
</p>
<p>
*: This guide doesn&#39;t cover the passwords that Konami hasn&#39;t released yet. Oh well.
