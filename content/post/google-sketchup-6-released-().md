<p>
I thought Google SketchUp had been released for public consumption before, but ... Google SketchUp 6 is available in both a free, as well as a pay Pro version, and it&#39;s quite impressive. Having played with other tools, like Rhino3D, this is significantly easier, but seemingly on-par, at least for rectangular objects.

Go to http://sketchup.google.com/ for more information. While you&#39;re there, take a look at the number of bonus packs available, all of which are seemingly free. There&#39;s a number of short videos, all of which make the software seem very easy.

Give it a look. And if you&#39;ve used a CAD-based program before, what do you think?
