<p>
I&#39;m at work, just finishing up my lunch period, and I&#39;m really wishing I had access to my Ubuntu machine right now.
</p>
<p>
The reason? I just put in a CD of 200 images - one of my backup CDs - and was hoping to get a quick glance at what images were contained on the CD.
</p>
<p>
However, Windows was crawling through the thumbnail generation. Adobe Bridge isn&#39;t much faster (but is what I ended up going with).

Grr ...
