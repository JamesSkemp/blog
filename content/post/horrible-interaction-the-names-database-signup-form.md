<p>
Gavin sent me an invitation way back in June to join The Names Database. This morning, having received the final reminder email, I decided to signup.
</p>
<p>
However, it seems that I have to invite 5 people (5 people who have never been told about this service) before I can join.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t know 5 people?&nbsp; Sorry. You can try adding fake people, but chances are someone already tried those (a@a.com - already invited).
</p>
<p>
Only force people to do something that they <em>must</em> do. This does not include telling other people about your &#39;service.&#39;
</p>
<p>
It looks like this is owned by the same people who brought you Classmates.com, so I think it&#39;s worth skipping anyway.
</p>
<h4>Update, August 6, 2007</h4>
<p>
Somehow was I not only added to the Names Database, but I also ended up on Classmates.com. Odd that I didn&#39;t sign up for that, but ...&nbsp; Also, I didn&#39;t even think I signed up to Names Database.
</p>
<p>
Very odd ...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m off Classmates.com (again), but I&#39;ll have to wait to hear back from the Names Database people until I&#39;m off that site.
