Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be posting the tutorial on setting up MySQL.  However, for today, I won&#39;t be posting a new tutorial, as I&#39;ve already spent the last hour writing one on setting up ColdFusion (which is the fourth tutorial I have to post, the MySQL one for tomorrow being the first).<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Setting up ColdFusion (for the second time, after uninstalling my first setup) was actually pretty easy.  However, it&#39;s very corporate usage, along with the large file size, installation size, and memory usage, all add up to make ColdFusion relatively painful for the average user.

<p>
Nonetheless, it&#39;s a language that I want to work in more, even though I can only use it in production at work, so I&#39;ve installed it on my development server (and sometime next week, you&#39;ll be able to as well).
</p>
<p>
On another note, I have a couple of good customer service items to bring up.
</p>
<p>
In December-ish, I picked up a Graphire 4, direct from Wacom.  As I noted a few posts ago, I received a free DVD after completing a survey, on Photoshop techniques.  I emailed customer service about a week ago, asking about when they may get some new pen nubs.  The one that came with my pen and tablet is still usable, but I&#39;d really like to have some spares.  While they are still out of stock, they sent me two free nubs, which I received in a matter of days.  Great customer service, in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I ordered the Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book from Adobe Press, direct.  Today I received the item, via UPS, and while I thought I&#39;d have to drive into Middleton to pick it up, they were actually able to leave it here - both examples of great service, especially when you consider that I only had to pay for the book and tax - UPS standard delivery was free.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a massive eight pages into the book, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m skipping out with the tutorial post.  Even though it would take less time, we all need a break today.
</p>
<p>
Look for the MySQL tutorial tomorrow evening, followed by the second part of it (in a way) on either Saturday or Sunday.
