<div class="warning">
<p>This application has since been updated. <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml.</a></p>
</div>
<p>iTunes Playlists to Xml, version 0.6b, is now available for download.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_0.6b.zip">Download iTunes Playlists to Xml - version 0.6b</a>.</p>
<p>This version now handles the bug where playlists could be out of date, by alerting the user.</p>
<p>This version also includes functionality to save the Xml file, as well as configure the name the application will use when generating the Xml file.</p>
<p>Because of security issues, I'm including a copy of the default XSLT with the application, with information about how to access the most recent copy.</p>
<p>I'll probably sit on this for a week or so, and release a final version shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Comments/suggestions/etcetera are welcome and appreciated.</p>
