First off, Gmail accounts are basically a dime-a-dozen these days, but if you&#39;re still looking to pick up an account, I have a number of invites I&#39;d be willing to shed.<!--more-->

<p>
Secondly, I really like the revisions Google has done to Gmail.  When I first read they would be working their messenger into Gmail, I was a little sceptical - after all, I was a Notifier user until they recommended the update to Talk, and I use Talk for the mail notification feature - not because I want to waste (sorry, in one sense it is a waste, but the interaction usually isn&#39;t a waste - just the thought that I could have done something productive, instead of interactive) my time chatting.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
However, the improvements don&#39;t take away from Talk at all - rather they expand upon them.  If I&#39;m away from my computer, but need to call up a conversation I had with someone the night before, that usually would mean that I&#39;d have to wait, or hope that I can some how connect to my computer.  With Gmail&#39;s new features, I can get my chat logs right from the Internet.

We&#39;re certainly moving towards an online desktop ...

No, I haven&#39;t forgotten about writing about getting Apache and the rest running on a computer.  I&#39;ve successfully removed most of the software from my current machine so I can do a fresh walkthrough.  Went for sushi tonight, so the night was shot.  Then I watched Photographic Workflow with Vincent Versace (a free Digital Innovator DVD I received after purchasing my Wacom Graphire and filling out a survey), after it having sat on my desk for over a month unwatched.  I&#39;m glad I held off, actually, since there&#39;s some really great tips that I otherwise would have wasted my time trying to use :D
</p>
<p>
This weekend, at the latest, I&#39;ll work through installing Apache, at the very least.

Before that, it&#39;s been six weeks since the new year - have you defragmented your hard drive this year?  With a newer operating system, it really isn&#39;t that bad.
