<p>
Grave of the Fireflies is a fairly (read: very) depressing story.  Supposedly, this film was named Best Animated Feature at a children&#39;s festival, yet I don&#39;t know that the intended audience is children.  Nonetheless, even though it&#39;s depressing, I think it&#39;s a good film, showing the hardships some people (have) face(d).<!--more-->

	Named Best Animated Feature at the 1994 Chicago International Children&#39;s Film Festival, this film proves that not all anime tales are pixie-dust fantasies or brutal sci-fi standoffs. Orphans Seita (voiced by Tsutomu Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi) fight for survival in post-World War II Japan, but society is harsh. Soon, they come to the somber conclusion that they can neither escape the hardships of war nor find enough food to survive.

I gave the movie four stars (out of five) since I thought it had a good message, but I don&#39;t feel it would appeal to the largest audience possible.  If the movie would have sugar-coated things more than it did, or made conditions even worse for the two, I would have given it a much lower rating.

After watching Ran last night, I&#39;ll be looking forward to watching either Blade Runner this weekend, or North by Northwest next week.
