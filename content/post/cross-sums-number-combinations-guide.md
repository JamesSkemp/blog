Quite a while ago - back in May of 2003 actually - I began work on a guide that would display every possible number combination for cross sum puzzles. Since then, a number of people have corrected mistakes that crept in, resulting in a number of different versions of the guide over the last (almost) two years.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Not too surprisingly, the guide has become something of a hit. I also created a Windows program, around the same time, that would allow people to find combinations based upon the number of blanks you&#39;re allowed, followed by the number you need to determine. It&#39;s really quite a simple program (and one that I may look at creating for the Web, perhaps using AJAX ...). 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m offering both for download here, absolutely free. (Of course, I always like to hear from people who have found any of my resources, whether they be articles or programs. And, I do have a PayPal link below if you&#39;d like to send a donation :D)

<p>
Since I haven&#39;t had too much need to update the program, I recommend you just down the version that doesn&#39;t have the upgrade utility. If you need assistance with the program, I have written a guide - the <a id="p116" href="/files/2006/04/crosssumshelperguide.pdf" title="Cross Sums Helper Guide">Cross Sums Helper Guide</a> [PDF: 136 KB] - was written during version 1.2, but is still quite applicable.

Note that cross sums puzzles can also be called cross additions, kakuro, and kakro. Some people compare them to sudoku problems, but I don&#39;t see the similarity at all. Basically, a suduko puzzle just uses the sum of 45. I&#39;ve never seen an easy cross sums of &#39;standard&#39; size, while I&#39;ve seen quite a plethora of easy &#39;standard&#39; size sudoku problems. In short? Your average standard cross sums is probably going to be more difficult than your average standard sudoku.
