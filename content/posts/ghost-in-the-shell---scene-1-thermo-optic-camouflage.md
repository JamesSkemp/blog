&quot;IN THE NEAR FUTURE - CORPORATE NETWORKS REACH OUT TO THE STARS, ELECTRONS AND LIGHT FLOW THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.

<p>
THE ADVANCE OF COMPUTERISATION, HOWEVER, HAS NOT YET WIPED OUT NATIONS AND ETHNIC GROUPS.&quot;

<p>
There&#39;s nothing to worry about. You can try it again once you&#39;re in our country. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Try it again?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Just as there&#39;s no such thing as a bug-free program there&#39;s no program that can&#39;t be debugged. Am I wrong? 
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t understand. We still don&#39;t know if it really is a bug. Project 2501&#39;s original purpose was-- 
</p>
<p>
Major, Section 6 is ready to move in. 
</p>
<p>
Major! 
</p>
<p>
I hear you. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of static in your brain. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s that time of the month. 
</p>
<p>
Won&#39;t there be trouble if Section 9 butts in on Section 6&#39;s operation? 
</p>
<p>
That diplomat&#39;s a pretty well-known bastard. Even if they catch him there, all they can do is deport him. We&#39;re the only ones who can get our hands dirty. 
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re moving. Take us over to the extraction point. 
</p>
<p>
(Kusanagi scales down the building while the police move in.) 
</p>
<p>
What? The police? 
</p>
<p>
Stop it! Who told you to open fire?! Drop your guns! 
</p>
<p>
I have diplomatic immunity! Let me see who&#39;s in charge! 
</p>
<p>
Transporting a listed programmer out of the country violates our arms export treaty. I could also have you charged with kidnapping. Give the man up. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m afraid not. He&#39;s applied for political asylum with us and he&#39;s already signed a statement to that effect! 
</p>
<p>
When?! 
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have to tell you! By right of international law, my country can offer him protection and right of safe passage. The document is on file at our embassy. I&#39;ll transfer a copy to you in a few days. 
</p>
<p>
Are you sure about this? They won&#39;t take you back alive. 
</p>
<p>
I must ask that you watch what you say. Our country is a peace-loving democracy. 
</p>
<p>
Is that a fact? 
</p>
<p>
(The diplomat is shot, to put it lightly.) 
</p>
<p>
Out the window! Shoot! 
</p>
