<p>
When Microsoft released IE 7 they also offered an image / virtual hard drive that could be used to test Internet Explorer 7, without installing it on your machine.
</p>
<p>
Good idea.
</p>
<p>
While they&#39;re buried, Microsoft has released a number of&nbsp;other images, which expire in January &#39;09.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=21eabb90-958f-4b64-b5f1-73d0a413c8ef&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="_blank">Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Image</a>
</p>
<p>
Come on Microsoft, release some that don&#39;t expire, but that have some other limited functionality. For example, they can only be used for x hours before the machine must be rebooted.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the hard drive could be restricted to some amount, so that only x MB/GB could be used.
</p>
<p>
Why not also allow this for other OS, including Server 2008/2003, Windows XP/Vista (multiple versions).
</p>
<p>
Allow developers more options for testing, and using, your technology, and it&#39;s more likely that we&#39;ll want to continue using the skills that we learn.
</p>
<p>
And, if we can test on more environments, then our products, whether they be Web-based or not, can be better tested and supported.
</p>
<p>
A win for everyone involved, I&#39;d say.
</p>
<p>
(Besides, if people are going to pirate your apps, they&#39;re going to do it. Why not make an easy and legit way for your future customers to get started and stay involved?)
