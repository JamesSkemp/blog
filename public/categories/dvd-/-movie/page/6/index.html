                                The following is a review of Cyberlink PowerDVD 15 Ultra, provided to me for free as part of the Amazon Vine program. Error 0110 When I was building my gaming PC I picked up a Blu-ray drive after a few weeks, to compliment the DVD player, and so I wouldn't need to power on my PlayStation 3 to watch certain movies. However, despite hearing good things about the free options I found the setup to be too large of a pain.

Plan changes After many years, on October 7, 2011, I dropped DVDs from my plan. I'm running low on time to get to DVDs with all the great games being released, and the price jump is a bit more than I'd like at this point.

                                Ever since I started my Netflix subscription in September 2006 I've been keeping track of what movies I receive and when. Unfortunately, as the years have gone by I've found it more and more difficult to easily look through the listings to see when I last watched a movie. Additionally, I've no longer been keeping track of what ratings I give movies, and why. The initial goal was really to track when Netflix shipped and received movies, as well as when I mailed and received.

                                Amazingly, although only in how fast time has gone by, my fifth year of Netflix has begun. This covers shipping with Netflix from September 26 2010 to approximately March 25 2011. See also the second half of year 4. MRNOS = Movie received and next one shipped The times 09/27/2010 (M) - MRNOS. 09/28/2010 (T) - Received and watched Iron Man 2 (2010), which I actually really liked, and am surprised I received so soon after release.

See also the first half of year 4. MRNOS = Movie Received and Next One Shipped The times 03/26/2010 (F) - MRNOS. 03/27/2010 (Sa) - Watched 1408 (2007) at my mom's (via Charter On Demand), which was pretty dang good. Received next movie, but since it's noticeably cracked, and I don't want to risk it, putting it right back in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.

                                Today I received my instant streaming disc for the Playstation 3 from Netflix. Having now moved around and watched a video, here are my thoughts. Note that I've watched Netflix streaming videos on my PC as well as on my Xbox 360. Thoughts As noted, currently the streaming capabilities require a disc. While this could perhaps be a download (and will be in the future), I don't believe it's too terrible that it requires a disc.

(Henceforth, MRNOS.) 03/28/2009 (Sa) - Received and watched Quantum of Solace (2008), which actually means I probably was the second person to have this disc.

                                Granted, it&#39;s only a dollar more, but in this economy ... Dear James, As you may know, Blu-ray movies are more expensive than standard definition movies. As a result, we&#39;re going to start charging $1 a month (plus applicable taxes), in addition to your monthly membership charge, for unlimited access to Blu-ray movies. The additional charge for unlimited Blu-ray access will be automatically added to your next billing statement on or after November 5th, 2008 and will be referenced in your Membership Terms and Details.

                                And so begins year three with Netflix. I covered year one and year two, of what was shipped to me, when, and when I shipped them back, previously. Since last year got a bit long, I&#39;m going to break it up a bit. So, this post covers shipping from September 26, 2008, to about halfway through (I&#39;m not there yet, so ...). Plan changes On 12/10/2008 I moved from the two-unlimited to the one-unlimited plan.

                                A lot of people like to pull full passages from Waking Life, as it&#39;s a very quotable movie. However, the problem with that is that if things change there&#39;s a whole lot of sites that are out-of-date. And, sometimes people forget to add attribution ... I&#39;ve been thinking about ways to make this easier, and believe I&#39;ve come up with an idea. Looking at the numbers, I&#39;m working from the most popular to the least popular chapters, with the goal of having all available.

A cyborg who goes diving in her spare time. That can&#39;t be a good sign. When did you start doing this? Doesn&#39;t the ocean scare you? If the floaters stopped working. Then I&#39;d probably die.

                                Pre-emptive clarifications First, by a &lsquo;good man&rsquo; we specifically mean here one who is truly good. By &lsquo;good&rsquo; we mean one who, by their actions, attempts to decrease the amount of evil. By &lsquo;evil&rsquo; we mean those actions which are disruptive towards a social, unified, ordered, society. For example, murder, theft and&nbsp;pillaging. This by no means exhausts all potential issues with the below, but if one assumes the common definitions, it should make sense.

                                I purchased a Casio EX-Z1200 a bit ago, which I&#39;ve been playing around with. Overall, I&#39;ve been very happy with it, however, it outputs movies to the MOV format. While this seemed great for Apple, it wasn&#39;t the best for me. After testing out QuickTime Pro (7. something) and Ulead Movie Wizard 3.2 SE VCD (which came with the camera), I was about to settle for less than I hoped for.

                                The first one is great (the cranky old man). The others have their good spots, but I wouldn&#39;t feel too bad having to shut it off after he left the stage. If it would have continued at this level through the end, it would truly have been great! See what else I&#39;ve been watching through Netflix.

                                So maybe you remember watching this when you were little, or think you must have. And maybe you watched the Robot Chicken episode covering this movie. And maybe you&#39;re really tired when you decide to watch this movie. You&#39;re in for comedy gold. Overall, a pretty good movie, with a good message that won&#39;t be lost. But, older and wiser, there&#39;s just too many loop-holes, and that Robot Chicken spoof will overpower everything else.

                                Catching up on the news, it seems Warner will be switching over to Blu-ray, exclusively, after May 2008. What surprises me is that they&#39;re just now saying that this is ending the format wars. The fact that Warner was supporting both, while Fox, Disney, Lion&#39;s Gate, MGM, and Sony were only Blu-ray (compared with Paramount and Universal going HD DVD, after Paramount was effectively paid-off) suggested, to me, that the &#39;war&#39; was already over.

                                Thanks to Rob Lumley, I&#39;ll be watching four different P.T. Anderson films over the extended holiday weekend. Brief comments on the first film&nbsp;watched,&nbsp;below. Hard&nbsp;Eight (1996) Interesting. In more than a couple of places, I was reminded of Jackie Brown. Lots of dialogue, but even more quiet, giving an emphasis to not only what is said, but what is not. It&#39;s slow, which may turn some away, but the story of Sydney is interesting all the same ...

                                Well, I missed this when&nbsp;it first came out, and only saw it while trying to find show times for tomorrow&nbsp;... Milwaukee, Wis., December 13, 2007..... Marcus Theatres Corporation, a division of The Marcus Corporation (NYSE: MCS), today announced it was not able to reach an agreement with Paramount Pictures on the film cost of the new motion picture, Sweeney Todd, which will be released by Paramount on December 21, 2007. "Unfortunately, as a result of the negotiations with Paramount reaching an impasse, Marcus Theatres will not be showing Sweeney Todd at any of its locations," said Bruce J.

                                I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie. Other editions may play differently, although since I don&#39;t discuss the audio or video components of this film, my review will stand as-is. This is, by far, one of the most wonderful films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. While I haven&#39;t been much of a Will Ferrell fan in the past, this movie has truly opened my eyes to just how great of an actor he really is.

                                I&#39;m a fan of PKD, but this documentary fails in a number of major areas, making it almost useless in its scope. First of all, the animations that are used in place of slides are annoying beyond _, but I suppose if they trimmed those up they&#39;d only have an hour of play time. The music reminded me of Assault on Precinct 13, and while it wasn&#39;t too bad, it was utterly diabolical when it was close to drowning out the interviewed individuals while they spoke.

                                I had previously written on how Netflix shipped and received DVDs, for Madison WI. This article continues that one, by discussing Year 2 with Netflix (first year began September 26, 2006). Plan changes On December 2, 2007, I decided to upgrade to the two at-a-time (unlimited)&nbsp;plan. Since my plan begins on the 10th of each month, that means I had to pay an extra $1.26 to upgrade now, instead of for the next month (I figure this way they&#39;ll send a movie out tomorrow morning).

                                I&#39;ve never been to New York City, at least, not that I can recall. However, media has, for various reasons, touched upon the city in a number of formats, in a number of ways, for a number of years. Without having ever been to New York City, I can say the following about it. Stay out of New York City. Common wisdom is right, New Yorkers are less human than people in other cities.

                                The following quotes are from movies. At the moment, it&#39;s just the two, but, more shall surely come. Look. The supermodel&#39;s a beautiful girl, Will. She can make you dizzy, like you&#39;ve been drinking Jack all morning. She can make you feel high for the greatest commodity known to man - promise, the promise of a better day, the promise of a greater hope, the promise of a new tomorrow. This particular ore can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl - in her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing about life seem OK.

                                My GitS: 2nd Gig knowledge is a bit rusty, so Solid State Society is definitely going to be one of those &#39;need to watch it at least twice&#39; movies. It seems the movie takes place after 2nd Gig, and therefore, outside of the realm of the other two movies. For two years the Major has been working outside of Section 9, which seems a bit off, since I was under the understanding (perhaps just from the movies) that if they quit, they forfeit pretty much everything ...

                                With over 6 hours left of instant watching time left, all that needs to be used before the 10th of the month, it was time for another movie ... This time it was the 2004 film Parasite Dolls. I knew nothing of the film before I watched it. In this anime adventure, androids with knock-out bodies and personalities have begun to take over every area of society. Known as Boomers, these stellar-looking beings begin to show that some are as un-human as you can get, and when their infiltration becomes too much to take, peacekeeper Branch must step in to make things right.

                                I watched Dominion Tank Police this evening, from Netflix. It&#39;s four acts, each consisting of about 35 to 40 minutes of movie (which includes approximately 1 1/2 minutes of opening and ending credits. What really attracted me to the movie was Masamune Shirow, who created not only this series, but also Appleseed (the newer one is more interesting than the original), Black Magic M-66 (which I haven&#39;t yet seen) and Ghost in the Shell (great movies and interesting shows).

                                Review for Sin: The Movie (1999); given 2 of 5 stars. These characters were completely new to me (at least, from what I can recall). Needing to burn some &lsquo;Watch Now&rsquo; time, I decided to give this a look, and was quite disappointed (even though I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much). After 15 minutes, I was ready to quit, but I figured it couldn&rsquo;t get any more confusing and decided to stick with it; I should have stopped.

I just finished watching Perfect Blue online (via Netflix). Believing that they do influence what movies are recommended, in a good way, I had to give it four stars, out of five. In Netflix terms, that&#39;s the difference between a &quot;Really Liked It&quot; and a &quot;Loved It.&quot; However, I really wanted to give it a five stars &hellip;</p>

                                As stated in another post, Netflix shipping, for Madison WI, I decided to give Netflix a try.&nbsp; I&#39;m still with them, and I&#39;ve watched a number of movies, that I may otherwise have had to purchase or rent elsewhere. For a limited time, you too can try Netflix for free.&nbsp; Go to www.netflix.com and enter the code of Friend63.&nbsp; This offer expires on June 30, 2006, but I do hope that means June 2007 ...

Quick review. I liked Cowboy Bebop, and I believe this was recommended from Amazon (for those who like Cowboy Bebop). Instead of purchasing the complete collection of Outlaw Star, I decided to try out one of the discs, containing the first five episodes, from Netflix.</p>

I&#39;ve been trying to get a pretty good range of movies through Netflix.  While it wasn&#39;t high on my list of movies that I wanted to see, it was a documentary, and therefore a good genre to put into the mix every once in a while.  While I&#39;m giving the movie three stars, I thought it was worthwhile to watch, but don&#39;t think I&#39;d sit through another viewing.</p>

Since I&#39;m not going to be able to write the article(s) that I wanted to tonight (since one is going to require research, and the other is going to involve thought) I figure I&#39;ll write up a quick review on The Departed, which I had the pleasure of seeing today.</p>

                                While it&#39;s true I probably should have watched 2001: A Space Odyssey a long time ago, I&#39;ve just gotten around to watching it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, perhaps I should have watched it sooner and have been done with it. While visually stunning, I&#39;m having a hard time finding any substance behind the movie that I can really grasp.&nbsp; All-in-all, I&#39;ve given 2001: A Space Odyssey a generous three stars, since while I&#39;m sure it was amazing when it first came out, it&#39;s, I hate to say it, kind of boring.

                                For many years, North by Northwest is a movie that I have wanted to see, if not consciously, then certainly at the back of my mind.&nbsp; Other than the somewhat sappy ending, North by Northwest was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. Directed by Hitchcock, this movie truly put me on the edge of my seat.&nbsp; The ending was quite a surprise, and the movie has aged extremely well in the over 40 years since it&#39;s release.&nbsp; Not only that, but Cary Grant truly shines in this movie, from beginning to end, truly an actor that others should aspire to beat.

Grave of the Fireflies is a fairly (read: very) depressing story.  Supposedly, this film was named Best Animated Feature at a children&#39;s festival, yet I don&#39;t know that the intended audience is children.  Nonetheless, even though it&#39;s depressing, I think it&#39;s a good film, showing the hardships some people (have) face(d).</p>

There are a number of movies out there that seem like they go on far longer than one would have thought.  Two hours long, but it feels like it&#39;s over four.  Ran is one of these movies, but in the best possible light.</p>

The first thing to always keep in mind, while watching any documentary, is that the producers always have an agenda in mind.  That said, this is the second Michael Moore film I&#39;ve seen (Fahrenheit <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> being the other), and the time I&#39;ve reminded myself to take everything with a grain of salt.</p>

At their best, the Japanese are one of the few groups that can create, again and again, movies that touch upon great philosophical questions and ideas.  Urusei Yatsura Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer, is one of those great philosophical movies that you could watch again, just for the dialogue.</p>

(Togusa:) &quot;Are we actually back in physical reality?&quot;
</p>
<p>
(Batou:) &quot;There is no way to distinguish reminiscence from true memory. Whatever they are, they can only be analyzed after the fact. The passage of time itself can&#39;t be stored, so it&#39;s tough. And inevitable, now that our e-brains share external memories. Do your wife and daughter, waiting for you at home, really exist?

&quot;This area was once intended as the Fear East&#39;s most important information center, a Special Economic Zone in its heyday. These towers survive as a shadow of the city&#39;s former glory.

Reminds me of the line, &#39;What the body creates, is as much an expression of DNA as the body itself.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Already this week, we&#39;ve had eight cases of gynoids murdering their masters. After each killing, they self-destruct, electronic brains reformatted. In each case, the model in question is Locus Solus #2052, &quot;Hadaly&quot; type. A prototype developed for testing, they were provided free of charge to contractors. Now, they&#39;ve recalled all the prototypes. According to their most recent report, they&#39;ve identified no defects in either software or hardware.&quot;

In a future time, when most human thought has been accelerated by artificial intelligence and external memory can be shared on a universal matrix, Batou, an agent of the elite Section 9 Security Force and a begin so artificially modified as to be essentially cyborg, is assigned, along with his mostly human partner, Togusa, to investigage a series of gruesome murders.

<p>
Time has passed since Batou&#39;s original partner, Major Motoko Kusanagi, cybernetically enhanced to such a degree that only her &quot;ghost&quot; remained human, disappeared into the Net. Since then, Batou has wondered where her ghost might be and if the Major will ever return ...

<p>I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is an extremely philosophical movie, so I have decided to watch and type up a transcript of the movie so that I could expand my own knowledge of the film. In the spirit of the Internet/Web, I provide it here as well to aid others.</p>

This last weekend I watched A Scanner Darkly, which had just hit a local Madison theatre on Friday.  I&#39;d been looking forward to the film since I&#39;d heard about it, and since it promised to showcase a look like <a href="http://strivinglife.com/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">Waking Life</a>.</p>

What bothers me is that now that I&#39;ve seen the movie, I want to donate - I want to write, etcetera - but where&#39;s the call to action?&nbsp; Turns out it&#39;s at www.climatecrisis.net By filling out just a couple of forms, you can send a message to your representatives.
