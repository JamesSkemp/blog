<p>
WordPress 2.1 was released today and, unfortunately, I&#39;m just not horribly impressed by the new feature list.&nbsp; Granted, it&#39;s a short feature list, but I see few reasons to upgrade.&nbsp; The main reason?&nbsp; Most of these features look like they&#39;re geared towards non-technical/shared-hosting users.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
What is interesting?&nbsp; Akismet update - but I&#39;m sure we can grab that without 2.1.
</p>
<p>
More efficient and faster database code?&nbsp; That&#39;s one.
</p>
<p>
Faster admin pages?&nbsp; Two.
</p>
<p>
The ability to denote more user categories - specifically to remove all rights from a user?&nbsp; Thr ...&nbsp; Nope, I don&#39;t see that.
