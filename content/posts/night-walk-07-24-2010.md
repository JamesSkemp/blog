<p>A white light.</p>
<p>A yellow.</p>
<p>A group of kids, playing a game of basketball, laughing, not keeping score.</p>
<p>Lights illuminating plants, a woman straightening her's in a newly purchased house, one she may not have been able to enjoy before.</p>
<p>It was Ray Bradbury, I believe, who wrote of a man who walked at night, and before being arrested for doing so, thought of the people sitting inside, their faces illuminated only by the light of a television. But there's something about a dark room, flickering with that changing light. Calming? Relaxing? It's the sign of the known. No matter what they might be watching - a movie, a sports game, a sitcom - it's familar, a common bond.</p>
<p>Light shining from the basement windows, from the second floor, but the first floor is dark. Is the basement full of work, or play? Has it been forgotten?</p>
<p>Light creeping out through the top of a curtain, blocked for a moment in regular beats. Is the ceiling fan wood? Painted?</p>
<p>A late night visitor, staying for only a moment before going back to their truck.</p>
<p>A rabbit seen, staring, as two others bounce away. The third follows. Another shortly thereafter. It too decides to leave.</p>
<p>People passed, given a nod and a smile. A younger couple, pushing a stroller. Safe to meet their eyes. But other than the eye contact and allowing for room to pass - for some reason it seemed he'd step in front, but he did the right thing - nothing.</p>
<p>Another light, a soft yellow light, comes from above blinds. It's a kitchen light. I know because I turned it on, knowing it would be dark when I got back. A cat, probably lazing somewhere, but awake. She greats me.</p>
