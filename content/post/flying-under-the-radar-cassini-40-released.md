<p>Visit <a rel="external" href="http://code.google.com/p/cassini/">Cassini on Google Code</a> to see the nice new interface and functionality. Of major importance is that it supports .NET Framework 4.</p>
<p>Tested on a Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit, machine.</p>
<h3>Note on building it yourself</h3>
<p>To save you some time, if you want to build a copy yourself open the project properties and on the Build tab check "Allow unsafe code." You should otherwise have no issues.</p>
