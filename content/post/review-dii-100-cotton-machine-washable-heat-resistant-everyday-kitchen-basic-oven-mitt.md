The following is a review of the DII 100% Cotton, Machine Washable, Heat Resistant, Everyday Kitchen Basic Oven Mitt, 9 x 8", Set of 2, French Stripe- Chambray Blue, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## What's an oven mitt if it can't keep your hand cool at oven temps?

(Since Amazon combines the reviews of a number of other items, if reading this review on Amazon, these are for the 9 x 8" oven mitts, specifically the French Stripe, Chambray Blue, style.)

Oven mitts have one main purpose, which is to protect one's hands from heat when taking something out of, or putting something into, the oven. The [DII Everyday Kitchen Basic Oven Mitts][review] does a good job of this for a few seconds, or at low heat, before beginning to fail at their job.

My girlfriend was the first to try these, and while initially mentioning how large they seemed on her hands (which having around the same size hands as her, I agreed with), it didn't take long for her to call out when the oven mitts did little to keep her hands protected when pulling out a cookie sheet from a 450 degree oven.

I tried them next, but by the time I had them on the sheet had sufficiently cooled that I didn't feel it. However, when we tested it out again by putting the cookie sheet in for two or three minutes, when I pulled it out I actually felt quite uncomfortable as I tried to transfer items (two slices of bread) off of the sheet.

Part of this probably has to do with the fact that there's no extra material or thickness on the palm of the mitts, like most mitts I've used.

While they look good, the [DII Everyday Kitchen Basic Oven Mitts][review] won't get much use in our house, and had I purchased them I would have returned them after the one day of use. However, for oven usage at lower temperatures, or possibly stove top usage, they may have limited usage. Since they don't seem to offer much protection at a relatively common oven temperature, and for the reasons above, I have to give these two of five stars.
