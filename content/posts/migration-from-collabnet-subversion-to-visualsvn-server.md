<p>Since it doesn't seem CollabNet is really going to keep their non-Edge Subversion application, I've decided to migrate to <a rel="external" href="http://www.visualsvn.com/server/download/">VisualSVN Server</a>. Roughly, here are the steps I went through to migrate, which also includes a 1.6.x upgrade.</p>
<p>
<h3>VisualSVN migration</h3>
<p><ol>
<li>Installed VisualSVN. Repositories saved to C:\Repositories</li>
<li>Setup existing users.</li>
<li>Import existing repositories.</li>
<li>Should already be upgraded, but upgrade to 1.5, just in case.</li>
<li>Upgrade TortoiseSVN.</li>
<li>Upgrade working copies to 1.7.</li>
</ol>
