<p>
In the spirit of Rob Lumley (rmlumley), who created <a href="http://rmlumley.com/2009/04/twitter-hash-tag/">#cubemusic</a>, and after a great walk today, I&#39;ve created an original hashtag: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23walkingmusic">#walkingmusic</a>.
</p>
<p>
For all those days I go for a walk (which I hope to be every Friday afternoon, at least), I&#39;ll be noting afterwards what music I listened to on my walk. It&#39;s very similar to #cubemusic, but not as likely to get you in trouble (even though I would assume there would be more than that to it). ;)

I use Twitter for the most simple of posts, but if you&#39;d like to <a href="http://twitter.com/strivinglife">follow me</a> ...
