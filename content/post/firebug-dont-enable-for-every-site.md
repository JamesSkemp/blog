<p>
After a deal of searching, I&#39;ve finally discovered why my Firefox browser was crashing so often. So often, in fact, that I have Internet Explorer 7 a chance (and it showed how much of a fight it can now put up).
</p>
<p>
The short story: don&#39;t enable Firebug for all sites.
</p>
<p>
Gmail has recently been warning about this, stating that slow-downs are likely. One config setting, <strong>javascript.options.strict</strong>, when set to true, can also cause issues with Google AdSense.
</p>
<p>
Now that I&#39;ve switched that to false, and only enabled Firebug for the sites that matter (the last wasn&#39;t necessary after changing the option, but it was nonetheless a good idea), I&#39;m back and rolling with Firefox.
</p>
<p>
Now that I&#39;ve been away for so long, though, I wonder if I should just uninstall all the versions I&#39;ve got on my computer and just install Firefox 3 ...&nbsp;
