<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBEVV8S?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Perfect Fitness Pushup Stands</a>, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p></div>

<h3>Makes pushups easy</h3>

<p>I don't find pushups all that difficult, outside of the fact that I just don't know what to do with my hands.</p>

<p>Since my apartment is carpeted, putting my hands into fists results in carpet marks on my ends, and some irritation. As a developer, who works on a computer most of the day, stretching my fingers out causes me some concern as I'm wary of wrist issues.</p>

<p>So I've eyed something like this product, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBEVV8S?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Perfect Fitness Pushup Stands</a>, for some time. However, reviews tend to be relatively poor for most products, which just doesn't make sense, since how difficult could it be to make such a product?</p>

<p>That resulted in me using some heavy 15# weights as makeshift stands. But being metal barbells, this resulted in my hands feeling soar after just a short amount of time.</p>

<p>When I saw the Perfect Fitness Pushup Stands as a possible item to try, I decided to give them a go. They certainly seemed like they would be workable. Having now used them for a little over two weeks, I'm impressed. In fact, I'm (not surprisingly) able to do many more pushups than I could before, using my rather lackluster alternatives.</p>

<p>The handles are comfortable (the size took a little bit to get used to), and with a wide base they feel very secure on my carpeted floors.</p>

<p>There certainly isn't much to them, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBEVV8S?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Perfect Fitness Pushup Stands</a> do exactly what you'd hope, and therefore get a full 5 stars from me. If you've constrained your pushups to the methods I've mentioned above, give these a try, and you might be as impressed as I.</p>
