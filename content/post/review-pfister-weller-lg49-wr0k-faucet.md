The following is a review of the Pfister Weller LG49-WR0K 2-Handle 8" Widespread Bathroom Faucet in Brushed Nickel, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Looks Nice, But Expect a More Advanced Installation
First, I've never installed a faucet before I tried installing this Pfister faucet. But now that I've tried to install one I've done so, but not this model.

A month or two ago we replaced the shower curtain rod, toilet paper, and hand towel holder, in the first floor bathroom, with ones that have a brushed nickel finish like this [Pfister Weller][review]. It only made sense for us to replace the faucet and knobs in the room as well, so when we had the opportunity to try out this faucet we decided we'd give it a go.

We ran into issues right away with removing the old Moen faucet since some water leakage resulted in some build-up that required a number of applications of CLR to allow us to unscrew something that probably wasn't tightened by hand when it was installed. We also have a pedestal sink, in the corner, so it was a pain to try to get back there.

Once that was done we started looking into installing the new sink. The first thing that we ran into is that despite the instructions saying there was a video online, we could find no such video for the Weller series.

Unlike a lower end (such as the $80 Pfister faucet that we ended up purchasing and installing), there's significantly more assembly required for this faucet. We also missed it the first time, and the outer box didn't note it, but since it's a wider faucet it didn't fit in either of our sinks.

The instructions were also a little lacking, at least in the area of how to install the faucets. We spent five to ten minutes debating how to put on the handles so they'd properly turn, before realizing that this wouldn't fit in our sink.

However, despite that we did find the Pfister faucet to look and feel really great. So we ended up picking up a [Pfister Ladera LF-048-LRGS][pfister-search] since we had sufficiently destroyed the old one while we were trying to pull it out. Most of this faucet was contained within one piece, which made it super easy to install.

Given our experiences with the [Pfister Weller LG49-WR0K][review], I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't replaced a bathroom faucet before. However, it looks great, and given our experience with the Pfister Ladera series faucet, I would recommend the brand, and this for someone who's replaced faucets before, and has a sink that supports a widespread faucet. For these reasons, four of five stars.
