<p>
Near the end of the January, I talked about installing ColdFusion on my home computer. Starting this week (hopefully), I&#39;ll be writing a number of posts detailing how to go about doing these installations, with the express purpose of creating an environment for the testing of Web pages, or the learning of HTML/PHP/ColdFusion.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Why? Because while it&#39;s easy to find a free Web site provider of the first, it&#39;s hard to find a free provider of the second and third. Besides, while there are a number of installations which will help you through the installation - by doing it automatically - like WAMP, it&#39;s just more interesting and understandable if you do it yourself.

Since it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve sat down and written a tutorial, it may be a bit hard around the edges at first, but I think it&#39;ll soften up as it comes along.

<p>
I&#39;d like to write until I get to a good stopping point for each, so the next post isn&#39;t so much a requirement, as a next step.
