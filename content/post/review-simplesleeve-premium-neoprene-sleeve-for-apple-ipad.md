<h3>A well made cover; one happy purchaser</h3>
<p>Seeing as how my Nexus 7 has officially converted me to Android tablets (although we'll see what Microsoft's Surface devices are priced at), I figured it was time to finally write a review for the item that's been keeping my iPad safe for almost a year and a half.</p>
<p>When I picked up my first-generation iPad I obviously needed something to carry it around in. I did a good deal of looking around, and finally settled upon the&nbsp;SimpleSleeve, Premium Neoprene Sleeve for Apple iPad by Grantwood, as the company was fairly active on Amazon for the product reviews.</p>
<p>Since April 2011 it's been protecting my iPad, and has yet to fail me. I've had my iPad fall from approximately 4 feet, and haven't even questioned whether it was damaged. I haven't picked up a 'shield' for the screen, and haven't regretted the decision.</p>
<p>I would zip and unzip my iPad at least 3 times a day, if not more on busier days, and haven't experienced any zipper issues. I've tossed this in bags (first an open one, and now a bookbag) and don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I have found that the back of the cover gets a little dirty, and at times I wish the plastic covered the same area on the reverse, to prevent against this. However, I don't find that to be too much of an issue.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I highly recommend this item. Since I can find no real issues with it, 5 of 5 stars.</p>
