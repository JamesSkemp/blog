Year's ago, Microsoft released Log Parser 2.2, which is a tool for analyzing IIS log files, event viewer exports, and etcetera.

There's a [Professor Windows article from May 2005](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb878032.aspx) which covers Log Parser, to some extent, and the [download is available from Microsoft](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd919274.aspx).

Unfortunately, it's all command line, but it seems interesting enough, nonetheless.

I would have liked to have used AWStats (and probably still will), but I just didn't want to bother with the config file today.

## Update, 9/13/2007

I'm really glad I found Log Parser, instead of simply using AWStats. For an IIS server, Log Parser is heaven sent.
