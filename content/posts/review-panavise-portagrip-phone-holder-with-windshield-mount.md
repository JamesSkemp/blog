<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CO3HCSY?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Panavise PortaGrip Phone Holder with Windshield Mount</a>, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p></div>

<h3>No suction due to cold, but great grip</h3>

<p>Right away let me say that I wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, a lack of suction made it impossible for me to fully test this in my car. However, given the weather in Wisconsin, I fully attribute that to the extremely cold weather.</p>

<p>Because of that, I'll review what I can, and will update once warmer weather returns.</p>

<p>So, that said, the grip on this mount is fantastic. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 with a very thin backing and had absolutely no issue with a strong grip.</p>

<p>By far, the nicest addition is the 'quick release' that allows you to quickly release your device from the holder.</p>

<p>If it weren't for the suction issue which prevented me from using this, I would have rated this fairly high. However, since I had no suction, and can't be completely sure whether it's due to the cold, I have to give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CO3HCSY?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Panavise PortaGrip Phone Holder with Windshield Mount</a> a neutral rating of 3 of 5 stars, but will update once I'm able to test the suction in warmer weather.</p>
