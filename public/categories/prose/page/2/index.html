                                A white light.
A yellow.
A group of kids, playing a game of basketball, laughing, not keeping score.
Lights illuminating plants, a woman straightening her's in a newly purchased house, one she may not have been able to enjoy before.
It was Ray Bradbury, I believe, who wrote of a man who walked at night, and before being arrested for doing so, thought of the people sitting inside, their faces illuminated only by the light of a television.

They do not stop on the way, they merely make their way
On ... on ... on stopping for none - needing no help  They brought what they need on their back
They need not turn back
They do not look behind them, to see that which they have left behind

It&rsquo;s not very often I get a standing ovation, and I believe it is solely due to you.  &nbsp;Ever since we first met, last night, I&rsquo;ve felt a strong connection to you, and this indeed fills me with great happiness.  &nbsp;Again, I thank you for you continued help and guidance,  Shelly  &nbsp;  May 16th  Shelly,  &nbsp;It was indeed my pleasure to be there on the 14th, but I fear that I cannot take credit for the, well deserved, standing ovation.

                                She was an attractive woman, quite attractive in fact. She was the kind of girl that you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at if she gave you her eyes, even if you were having one of the most shit-filled days in your life up to that point.  She walked over, not quickly, but not slow. It was a perfect pace for a girl in her profession. If you move to quickly, you make the customer think that you&rsquo;re desperate, while moving too slow gives off a feeling of disinterest, or boredom, both of which scare a customer away, or instil a like sensation within them.

my darling
sweet
When first we met
oh
so long ago
you whispered sweet nothings
into my ear
I recall the day
you wore that flowered dress
that you told me that you loved me
that you would be mine
that I could have all
I need merely ask
Then one day
when the birds were leaving
we sat under our tree and you told me
oh

                                What happens to a dream deferred?
I ask What happens to a dream deterred?
Could it be that the dream is the life deterred?
If the dream is the life deterred, and the dream is deferred, then what?
Is not the dream a life?
Is not the life a dream?
Is there one life?
Is there one dream?
Perhaps it is as such, that the dream is not singular.

                                January 11 2005: I noticed a missing parenthesis, so I made the change &ndash; this is such a minor change that it has no real impact upon the document as a whole.   &lt;Address Information Removed&gt;  Mr. Fitz,  On March 3rd 2004 I found, much to my dismay, an individual attributing various unsatisfactory statements to you, Richard Fitz. I, having read contrary statements in articles that you had previously written, felt that the very least I could was point out said statements to this individual, as well as suggest to them that they contact you directly regarding said statements.

I&#39;d tell someone, and I&#39;d only end up with pain, a blistering pain. I have chunks missing, each time, I have less on the scale. I try my best, I know that I do, but it&#39;s hard, you know?

                                But the thing of it is, is that you cannot possibly know what that is like.  But I don&#39;t need to try it in order to know that I am not going to like it. It&#39;s something that I know, something that I will always know. I mean, you were told by your friends what it would be like, but I don&#39;t have that, I don&#39;t have friends that I could get that information from.
