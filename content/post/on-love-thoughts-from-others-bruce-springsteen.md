<p>
I&#39;ve been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since I first listened to the album Born in the USA (on cassette), way back, many, many years ago. Most of the music/songs that I enjoy are because of women, but Bruce Springsteen is one of the few artists that I enjoy because of a man. In this case, my father had the tape, but it was women who gave the music true meaning.&nbsp; Anywho ... 
</p>
<p>
Probably one of his most interesting songs I heard was many years later, when I bought a copy of 18 Tracks.&nbsp; The text of that song follows. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	When I get home from my job I turn on my T.V.<br />
	But I can&#39;t keep my mind on the show<br />
	When I lay down at night, oh I can&#39;t get no sleep<br />
	So I turn on my radio<br />
	But the only sound I hear is you whisperin&#39; in my ear<br />
	The words that you used to say<br />
	Now my days grow longer<br />
	&#39;Cause my love grows stronger<br />
	And the fever gets worse<br />
	And I&#39;ve got the fever for this girl<br />
	<br />
	CHORUS<br />
	Got the fever, oh I&#39;ve got the fever<br />
	Nothing that a po&#39; boy can do<br />
	When he&#39;s got the fever for this girl<br />
	Got the fever, oh I&#39;ve got the fever<br />
	Left this little boy blue<br />
	<br />
	I can remember comin&#39; home<br />
	See you standin&#39; at the stove<br />
	With the dishes on the table<br />
	Dinner ready to go<br />
	We&#39;ll maybe go out to a movie show<br />
	Something that you like to see<br />
	Well now you are my sun in the morning<br />
	And my moon at night<br />
	I think about you baby<br />
	I feel alright<br />
	Now my days grow longer<br />
	&#39;Cause my love grows stronger<br />
	And the fever gets worse<br />
	And I&#39;ve got the fever for this girl<br />
	<br />
	CHORUS 
	</p>

The next, from The River, I first heard on the old Live/1975-85 three-disc set. It&#39;s probably best heard with his live text, where he actually talks about waht the song means to him. Nonetheless, a very great song.&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	I come from down in the valley<br />
	where mister when you&#39;re young<br />
	They bring you up to do like your daddy done<br />
	Me and Mary we met in high school<br />
	when she was just seventeen<br />
	We&#39;d ride out of that valley down to where the fields were green<br />
	<br />
	We&#39;d go down to the river<br />
	And into the river we&#39;d dive<br />
	Oh down to the river we&#39;d ride<br />
	<br />
	Then I got Mary pregnant<br />
	and man that was all she wrote<br />
	And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat<br />
	We went down to the courthouse<br />
	and the judge put it all to rest<br />
	No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle<br />
	No flowers no wedding dress<br />
	<br />
	That night we went down to the river<br />
	And into the river we&#39;d dive<br />
	Oh down to the river we did ride<br />
	<br />
	I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company<br />
	But lately there ain&#39;t been much work on account of the economy<br />
	Now all them things that seemed so important<br />
	Well mister they vanished right into the air<br />
	Now I just act like I don&#39;t remember<br />
	Mary acts like she don&#39;t care<br />
	<br />
	But I remember us riding in my brother&#39;s car<br />
	Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir<br />
	At night on them banks I&#39;d lie awake<br />
	And pull her close just to feel each breath she&#39;d take<br />
	Now those memories come back to haunt me<br />
	they haunt me like a curse<br />
	Is a dream a lie if it don&#39;t come true<br />
	Or is it something worse<br />
	that sends me down to the river<br />
	though I know the river is dry<br />
	That sends me down to the river tonight<br />
	Down to the river<br />
	my baby and I<br />
	Oh down to the river we ride 
	</p>

Many times I listened to this song on those summer nights of old ...&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Hey little girl is your daddy home<br />
	Did he go away and leave you all alone<br />
	I got a bad desire<br />
	I&#39;m on fire<br />
	<br />
	Tell me now baby is he good to you<br />
	Can he do to you the things that I do<br />
	I can take you higher<br />
	I&#39;m on fire<br />
	<br />
	Sometimes it&#39;s like someone took a knife baby<br />
	edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley<br />
	through the middle of my soul<br />
	<br />
	At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet<br />
	and a freight train running through the<br />
	middle of my head<br />
	Only you can cool my desire<br />
	I&#39;m on fire
	</p>

Springsteen released two albums, around the same time, and while 57 Channels (And Nothin&#39; On) was the song that I really enjoy from this, but this song sheds much on our subject. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	You and me we were the pretenders<br />
	We let it all slip away<br />
	In the end what you don&#39;t surrender<br />
	Well the world just strips away<br />
	<br />
	Girl, ain&#39;t no kindness in the face of strangers<br />
	Ain&#39;t gonna find no miracles here<br />
	Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin&#39;<br />
	But I got a deal for you right here<br />
	<br />
	I ain&#39;t lookin&#39; for praise or pity<br />
	I ain&#39;t comin&#39; &#39;round searchin&#39; for a crutch<br />
	I just want someone to talk to<br />
	And a little of that Human Touch<br />
	Just a little of that Human Touch<br />
	<br />
	Ain&#39;t no mercy on the streets of this town<br />
	Ain&#39;t no bread from heavenly skies<br />
	Ain&#39;t nobody drawin&#39; wine from this blood<br />
	It&#39;s just you and me tonight<br />
	<br />
	Tell me, in a world without pity<br />
	Do you think what I&#39;m askin&#39;s too much<br />
	I just want something to hold on to<br />
	And a little of that Human Touch<br />
	Just a little of that Human Touch<br />
	<br />
	Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize<br />
	Well it comes at a hard hard price<br />
	You can&#39;t shut off the risk and the pain<br />
	Without losin&#39; the love that remains<br />
	We&#39;re all riders on this train<br />
	<br />
	So you&#39;ve been broken and you&#39;ve been hurt<br />
	Show me somebody who ain&#39;t<br />
	Yeah, I know I ain&#39;t nobody&#39;s bargain<br />
	But, hell, a little touchup<br />
	and a little paint...<br />
	<br />
	You might need somethin&#39; to hold on to<br />
	When all the answers, they don&#39;t amount to much<br />
	Somebody that you could just to talk to<br />
	And a little of that Human Touch<br />
	<br />
	Baby, in a world without pity<br />
	Do you think what I&#39;m askin&#39;s too much<br />
	I just want to feel you in my arms<br />
	Share a little of that Human Touch<br />
	Feel a little of that Human Touch<br />
	Give me a little of that Human Touch
