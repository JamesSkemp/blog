<p>
What happens to a dream deferred?<br />
<br />
I ask What happens to a dream deterred?<br />
<br />
Could it be that the dream is the life deterred?<br />
<br />
If the dream is the life deterred, and the dream is deferred, then what?<br />
<br />
Is not the dream a life?<br />
Is not the life a dream?<br />
<br />
Is there one life?<br />
Is there one dream?<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is as such, that the dream is not singular.<br />
Perhaps it is as such, that the life is not singular.<br />
Yet the life is quite singular, and so too is the dream.<br />
Yet the plurality that runs through both can not be denied.<br />
<br />
Who am I to deny it?<br />
Who am I to question it?
