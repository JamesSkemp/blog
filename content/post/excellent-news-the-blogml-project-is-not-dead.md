<p>While it seemed to be near death, if not dead, at least as far as new releases, the BlogML project is not dead, and has been undergoing a number of needed changes since the end of January.</p>
<p>My StackOverflow question "<a rel="external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4234852/is-the-blogml-project-dead-and-what-are-some-alternatives/">Is the BlogML project dead, and what are some alternatives?</a>" was answered yesterday by the project originator (one of the great things about StackOverflow, and the entire network of sites).</p>

<li><a rel="external" href="http://code.google.com/p/blogml/">blogml project page</a></li>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://blogml.codeplex.com/">BlogML .NET project page</a></li>
<li><a rel="external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blogml-discuss">BlogML discussions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Being something that I've kept my eye on for a number of months, this is definitely something I'm keeping my eyes on.</p>
