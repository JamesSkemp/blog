<p>
With a new host, comes a unique move.
</p>
<p>
Previously I was using WordPress, since I was hosted on a Linux (shared) server. Fortunately, I&#39;ve decided to move to a Windows VPS, since the month of June was full of either slow down, or completely down, times. Since I don&#39;t want to install PHP and MySQL (which I would want to pay for the external dbs anyway), I&#39;ve decided to switch my content out of WordPress.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s unfortunate, since I&#39;ve spent so much time with it, but I think, in the long run, it&#39;s going to be for the best.
</p>
<p>
Five years from now, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ll be. However, I would like to still be doing development work, particularly with ColdFusion. However, if I can find the time to actually play around with .NET, that&#39;s another skill I&#39;d like to pick up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time getting a development environment on my home computers, and since I won&#39;t be picking up a copy of Windows XP Pro any time soon (however, if you use the donate link at the bottom of the page, you can make it that much sooner :D ), that will continue to be based upon Apache.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I think the move to BlogEngine.NET is going to be the best, in the long run. WordPress is getting so commercial now, and there&#39;s still so many problems with it. With BlogEngine.NET, however, there&#39;s definitely more of a home-brew attitude, and at least at this point in the game, the commercial aspect isn&#39;t apparent (however, that&#39;s not to say that they won&#39;t be competiting with WordPress soon, in some sense - seeing as how they are different languages).
</p>
<p>
Another benefit is that BlogEngine.NET can be run without a database. I could get MSSQL running on my box, but ... why bother when I don&#39;t have to at this point? Of course, that&#39;s not to say that SQL is bad (quite the contrary), but it can be a bit of a resource hog ...
</p>
<p>
The Framing Business, which I was also hosting, will be moved to it&#39;s own, WordPress-specific, service. I&#39;ll still be responsible for administering it, but that&#39;s easy enough to do, and if it keeps Gavin posting, that&#39;s all the better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got until September until my old host comes up for renewal, so I do believe I&#39;ll have plenty of time to move everything over to their respective servers, and enough redirection time. I&#39;ll also need to determine what I&#39;m going to do as far as redirects ... but that shouldn&#39;t be too big of an issue. 
</p>
