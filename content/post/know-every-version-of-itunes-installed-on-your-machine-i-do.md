<p>I've installed the following versions of iTunes on my machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>7.0.2.16</li>
<li>7.1.1.5</li>
<li>7.2.0.35</li>
<li>7.3.1.3</li>
<li>7.5.0.20</li>
<li>7.6.2.9</li>
<li>8.0.2.20</li>
</ul>
<p>Know how I know that? It seems that all Apple software on Windows (iTunes, QuickTime, and Safari, at least) leaves their traces in the following directory: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Apple Computer\Installer Cache\</p>
<p>313 MB of space is what I would recover if I deleted all the folders they created. Yikes.</p>
