<p>
This weekend we went down to the Capitol for Madison&#39;s farmer&#39;s market on the square.
</p>
<p>
While walking towards the square (the streets surrounding the Capitol building) I overheard a glimpse of a man&#39;s speech. While I only heard part of, and I have no idea what was going on before or after the conversation, it sounded quite like a monologue.
</p>
<p>
The gist of his speech was that there&#39;s a fight to give illegal immigrants legal status in America. However, his brothers (I hesitate to say that, as I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the word he said, but I can&#39;t think of what else the word could have been) are sitting in jails.
</p>
<p>
While illegal immigrants have been on my mind, as a philosophical/political issue, this individual brought up a rather good point.
</p>
<p>
From his perspective, he was seeing some rather interesting actions coming from America.
</p>
<p>
To some sense, I share his wonder.
</p>
<p>
But, as regards this general issue, I&#39;m still thinking on it ...&nbsp;
