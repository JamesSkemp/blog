<p>As I'm not a designer, I&nbsp;typically use open source designs, such as those from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oswd.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Web Design</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opendesigns.org/" target="_blank">Open Design Community</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.openwebdesign.org/" target="_blank">Open Web Design</a>&nbsp;(please post a link if you know of more).</p>
<p>If you have a design that you would like me to convert to BlogEngine.NET, whether it be your own or another's (if you have permission), please just let me know!</p>
<p>Likewise, if you need help working on your own theme, let me know!</p>
<p>Comments/etcetera appreciated.</p>
