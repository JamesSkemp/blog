<p>
So maybe you remember watching this when you were little, or think you must have. 
</p>
<p>
And maybe you watched the Robot Chicken episode covering this movie. 
</p>
<p>
And maybe you&#39;re really tired when you decide to watch this movie. 
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re in for comedy gold. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, a pretty good movie, with a good message that won&#39;t be lost. But, older and wiser, there&#39;s just too many loop-holes, and that Robot Chicken spoof will overpower everything else. 
</p>
<p>
Beware the catchy theme song!
