<p>In no particular order, here are the video games I'm currently looking forward to playing in 2010.</p>
<p>Note that some games may have been released earlier. Consoles that games can be released for are the PS2/PS3, Xbox 360, or Wii (which therefore includes GameCube games). Since I will probably not be getting an Xbox Live Gold subscription this coming January, and am going to go back to playing RPGs on PS systems only, when possible, PS3&nbsp;versions of multi-console releases&nbsp;will be higher on my list. Of course, FFXIII on PS3 is a no-brainer, even if I was hard-core Xbox 360.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bioshock 2 (Feb 2010)</li>
<li>Tales of Vesperia (release for the PS3 w/ unknown date)</li>
<li>Star Ocean: The Last Hope International (Feb 2010 for PS3)</li>
<li>Final Fantasy XIII (Mar 2010)</li>
<li>Resonance of Fate (May 2010)</li>
<li>Mass Effect 2 (Jan 2010)</li>
<li>Demon's Souls (Oct <strong>2009</strong>, once it drops in price a bit more)</li>
<li><a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Review-Borderlands.aspx">Borderlands</a> (<strong>2009</strong>, once it drops in price a bit more)</li>
<li>BioShock (for the PS3)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are the games that all signs point to interest being high, but that I'm not interested in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;II - Disappointed by the first one, and combat on this one looks pretty boring.</li>
<li>Dragon Age: Origins - Looks as though it would be good on the PC, but doubtfully so on consoles.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
