                                On July 13, 2007 I converted my blog over from WordPress to BlogEngine.NET (having previously used custom code written in PHP).
It was a great switch, as I was beginning to really dig into .NET, and I've found there's no better way to learn something than actually doing something with it.
While I don't think I did much with the beta, I was in on 1.0 and was fairly active at first.

                                I've been using GitHub for a little more than a month now, and it's been about 2 weeks since I shut down the machine running my local Subversion instance.
GitHub for Windows needs some work, but given that Phil Haack is/was working on the Windows aspect, I feel pretty confident that it'll continue to get better.
Moving to a system that allows for public repositories also allowed me to publish some really old code, that might be of benefit to someone.

                                Today I decided to finally make progress on a couple pending applications. As part of that process I needed to upgrade one of my sites to .NET 4. Unfortunately it has a child application that needs to say as .NET 2.0/3.5. After approximately 30 minutes of downtime, I finally got things configured correctly (seemingly). Here's what I ended up having to do.
This assumes IIS 7.5.
 Wrap the system.web and system.

Plan changes After many years, on October 7, 2011, I dropped DVDs from my plan. I'm running low on time to get to DVDs with all the great games being released, and the price jump is a bit more than I'd like at this point.

                                When I moved from my custom system to WordPress to BlogEngine.NET I never did end up copying over all the old comments on my posts. Heck, I don't even think I moved over all my posts.
But since I'm sticking with DISQUS I decided to move all my BE.NET comments over to DISQUS, and over the last few hours have been making the necessary changes and performing the necessary cleanup.&nbsp;

                                I picked up an electronic copy of jQuery Mobile by Jon Reid a little while ago and have been slowly making my way through it.
I've finally gotten to the point where I wanted to try creating a jQuery Mobile version of my video game listing.

In addition to jQuery Mobile, this also uses oXygen XML Editor, for taking the original XML source and transforming it via an XSLT 2.

                                Somehow, while I wasn't looking, the Log Parser Plus Web site has grown to what I consider a nice size over the last handful of months.
As the Log Parser Plus Web site moves towards 2000 visits a month I'll be making a number of changes in an attempt to make it even more useful.
Some changes I've already made:
 Implemented a new design. Added login functionality. Added ELMAH support.

                                My Web site on Microsoft Log Parser gets a fair amount of monthly traffic, but I've never really been happy with the design, which has been in place since I created the site back in September of 2008.
While I was fully intending on updating the site last week (as well as doing a slew of other productive things), I finally did so this morning.

To be on this list I must have purchased the album in 2010. This also doesn't include all albums I purchased.
Easy winners What Is Free To a Good Home? and Knives Don't Have Your Back&nbsp;- Emily Haines &amp; The Soft Skeleton : Emily Haines was on my 'too hard to tell' list last year, and this year I ended up picking up her four CD digital collection on iTunes.

                                I recently had the need to determine what types of music I had within my collection of music. Since I&nbsp;created iTunes Playlists to Xml so that I could export out my library on my iPod, it was easy enough to run that and then open LINQPad to run the following query.
Obviously, you must export the Genre field in order for the following query to work.
// Location to the XML from iTunes Playlists to XML String playlistXml = @&ldquo;C:\Users\James\Projects\services\WcfRestService\App_Data\playlistXml.

MRNOS = Movie received and next one shipped
The times 09/27/2010 (M) - MRNOS.
09/28/2010 (T) - Received and watched Iron Man 2 (2010), which I actually really liked, and am surprised I received so soon after release.

Most recent at the top, and does not include all deliveries.

                                The more I do with Microsoft technologies the hard it becomes for me to want to move outside of them. With the .NET Framework and Visual Studio 2010, which is the best development tool I think I've ever used, it's easy to get sucked in.
Since I've wanted to experiment with it for a while, and since I needed to do some kind of development after slacking off this weekend, I looked into creating a simple Silverlight application that would use the same Web service I created late last month.

Consider this an idea-based release. As such, this application is in no way final (but might be more complete after this long weekend).
Download Music Recommendations Please! version 0.5, beta.
You can see a general idea of where I'd like to end up by reading my music application idea.
.NET Framework 4 is required for this application.

                                Surprisingly, it was way back in September of last year that I realized Music Recommendations Please!, which I hoped would help me discover new music (and perhaps help others as well).
Since then&nbsp;I haven't used it as much as I would have hoped, but that's mostly because I'm not happy with how easy it is to get more than one artist in at a time, and generate helpful 'reports' from data returned for multiple artists.

                                After converting one Web site over to ASP.NET MVC 2 yesterday, I ported my second one today.
The first Web site was originally just a bunch of static HTML pages, so it was fairly easy to move over. This one, LogParserPlus.com, gets all of its data from a collection of XML files. Using LINQ to XML the files are read and parsed out to the page, using a Repeater control.

                                On Saturday (when I'm actually writing this, but I can't have 3 posts on one day, after my posting history the last handful of months) I finally ported a Web site over to ASP.NET MVC.
The existing Web site was for a client who just needs a simple, static, Web site, with a half dozen areas for content. However, if they were given the ability to directly post content to the site - news, specials, etcetera - I believe they might.

The times 03/26/2010 (F) - MRNOS.
03/27/2010 (Sa) - Watched 1408 (2007) at my mom's (via Charter On Demand), which was pretty dang good. Received next movie, but since it's noticeably cracked, and I don't want to risk it, putting it right back in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.

While some people may have much prettier, and extensive, configurations, I prefer something that I can let sit on my screen on top of everything&nbsp;(assuming Windows doesn't let other applications bump on top of it every once in a while), giving me only the information I need.

                                For the last handful of months I've been thinking about accessing the Internet, and otherwise being productive,&nbsp;while on the go.
A number of months back I picked up an HP device with Windows Mobile, unfortunately, after a few months the short battery life and inability to run the applications I wanted/needed to be truly productive forced me to sell it and start looking elsewhere ...
iPod Touch The iPhone had been out for a while when I started looking at what&nbsp;an iPod Touch could offer.

 Having only listened to the radio a few times over the last year, I have a good idea of just what music I&rsquo;ve listened to, since my iPod keeps track of everything.
With the help of iTunes Playlists to Xml&nbsp;and LINQPad, here&rsquo;s my favorite new (to me) album purchases of 2009.
To be on this list I must have purchased the album in 2009.

                                I don't much believe in New Year's Resolutions, or the like. Instead, I believe that if you want to change something, you should just do so.
But, it's nice to have a start date, so here goes.
2009 'resolutions' Not necessarily resolutions, these were things I decided to do or try in 2009.

                                In no particular order, here are the video games I'm currently looking forward to playing in 2010.
Note that some games may have been released earlier. Consoles that games can be released for are the PS2/PS3, Xbox 360, or Wii (which therefore includes GameCube games). Since I will probably not be getting an Xbox Live Gold subscription this coming January, and am going to go back to playing RPGs on PS systems only, when possible, PS3&nbsp;versions of multi-console releases&nbsp;will be higher on my list.

 Microsoft Log Parser is a command line-based utility useful to parse IIS logs and more.
While a number of applications exist to help use Log Parser, as well as a number of sites containing Log Parser queries, I haven&rsquo;t been very happy with them.
In an attempt to make it even easier to work with Log Parser, I present version 0.

                                It still needs a touch of work, but a basic custom brush for Syntax Highlighter is available for download.
Download the Microsoft Log Parser custom brush for Syntax Highlighter 2.0.320.
Example included below and at LogParserPlus.com:
logparser -rtp:-1 "SELECT cs-uri-stem, cs-uri-query, date, sc-status, cs(Referer) INTO 200sReport.txt FROM ex0902*.log WHERE (sc-status &gt;= 200 AND sc-status &lt; 300) ORDER BY sc-status, date, cs-uri-stem, cs-uri-query" Comments and suggestions are welcomed.

                                While it was at the same stage as it is now back on the 19th, I'm finally releasing the beta version of iTunes Music to SQLite.
This console application finds all Music playlists in iTunes and imports them into a SQLite database (called iTunesMusic.s3db).
You can change this by passing the database and source names as parameters.
For example:
iTunesMusicToSQLite.exe "datum.db" "James Skemp's 80 gig" You can run the executable and it will prompt for a key press before exiting, in case you want to view any messages.

                                Unfortunately, Microsoft Log Parser is unable to convert logs into SQLite. To work around this limitation I've created IIS Logs to SQLite, which will parse IIS logs and import them into the SQLite database and table of your choice.
The first beta version of this application is now available.
Download IIS Logs to SQLite version 0.1.
This application requires the .NET Framework version 3.5 (check your version of .NET Framework).

 The one problem I have with music is when I try to find new music that I may like. Luckily there&rsquo;s a number of services that will provide recommendations, but these are typically only based on one artist, or across my entire library (in the case of the iTunes Genius service).
To make this a bit easier, I looked at Last.

                                For releases of iTunes Playlists to Xml I've just been creating new posts with details, but that doesn't make all that much sense.
So, I've created an actual project/product page for the application.

What it does While iTunes has an Xml export option, it will export only those tracks from your computer, doesn&rsquo;t allow you to choose what data to export (unless you play with the view), uses a bulky Xml format, and won&rsquo;t export from other sources (like iPods).

                                Based on metamorph_watercircles, and converted for use with BlogEngine.NET, watercircles is now in use on my site.
The theme has a deal of special inline modifications for my own particular purposes, so it's not generally available for BlogEngine.NET users, but if you're interested ...
Comments welcome. (I'm sure I'll find things I missed as the weeks go by, but any findings are appreciated.)

 Greetings,
This morning, from approximately 2:15 to 2:30 am, a number of spam messages were posted to the blog at strivinglife.com/words/ .
These comments all originated from the ip 216.8.168.77, for which you are listed as the abuse contact.
Because of the way this particular system is setup, and the time between comments, this seems to have been an actual human being posting these comments.

                                I may get to some of these early, but here's a listing of things that I'd like to get done in July 2009. For the most part, they are technical things.
Speed-up my iTunes Playlists to Xml application. The generation of the Xml output takes longer than I would like, and if a DataTable makes sense, it would be worth caching the playlist so clicking on the playlist again doesn't cause another, slow, load.

Instead of immediately connecting to iTunes, the application now allows (and requires) that you manually begin that process.

                                To a very large extent, I consider myself to be a gamer.
Around the time the NES came out, my family picked up an Atari 2600, used. I don't know who sold it to us, but I can remember going with my dad to pick it up at my school's playground (that was the meeting place).
At a later point we picked up an NES, via my dad, and then my mom bought us a SNES.

                                I don&#39;t really believe in making New Year&#39;s resolutions, since it&#39;s something people do, knowing that they&#39;re going to fail at. In my opinion.  So, for my 28th, I&#39;m doing something a little different, in that I&#39;m declaring that I will continue to do what I&#39;ve been doing, for a couple of key items. No more soda  I&#39;ve been off soda for a couple of months, and before that I was down to just one-ish a day.

                                I back-dated my first piece of jQuery code, but have decided not to with my second.
Anyways, I had a hard time finding code, written in jQuery, to pull data from an Xml file and add it to a page. Combining a couple of tutorials online, I created the following (on April 27).
This was for a message, so I started out with the Xml file, creating something like this:

                                In the spirit of Rob Lumley (rmlumley), who created #cubemusic, and after a great walk today, I&#39;ve created an original hashtag: #walkingmusic.  For all those days I go for a walk (which I hope to be every Friday afternoon, at least), I&#39;ll be noting afterwards what music I listened to on my walk. It&#39;s very similar to #cubemusic, but not as likely to get you in trouble (even though I would assume there would be more than that to it).

                                This is the first piece of jQuery that I wrote, for production use, that works exactly as I'd like it to. Some code has been changed.
try { $(document).ready(function(){ $('div#headerLogin') .prepend($(document.createElement('div')) .addClass('headerLoggedIn') .append('Logged in as: &lt;span&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#query.displayName#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/logout/"&gt;logout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;') ); $('div.headerLoggedIn') .after('&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;cfif IsDefined("query.first_name") AND Trim(query.first_name) NEQ ""&gt;, &lt;cfoutput&gt;#query.first_name#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/cfif&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'); }); } catch (ex) {} It's for a site that runs ColdFusion, hence the CF tags.
Basically it finds the div with an id of headerLogin and adds to that a new div, with a class and some text.

                                Often times, like this morning, I&#39;ve got anywhere between 5 to 60 minutes of time to kill.  It doesn&#39;t make sense to do anything truly productive, so I end up visiting a number of sites. techmeme.com, dailyrotation.com, news.google.com, etcetera. Then I get desperate and visit weather.gov.  However, once I&#39;ve visited these, I run low on ideas of other sites, like these, that I can visit.  Any recommendations on sites that combine news, from a number of different sources, that is also interesting?

                                When I think of Europe I think of the U.K., France, then Germany. What about Spain though?  Moving east, Japan and China, followed by North Korea. I realize that India should be on the list, but it&#39;s not one that immediately comes to mind.  Africa, as a whole, is not on the list; only bad things come to mind (AIDs and spammers/scammers).  Same with Israel; isn&#39;t it bad that&nbsp;I think not of religiousness, but rather of constant war?

Plan changes There have been no changes at this time.
The times 03/27/2009 (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. (Henceforth, MRNOS.)
03/28/2009 (Sa) - Received and watched Quantum of Solace (2008), which actually means I probably was the second person to have this disc.

                                Having used a number of amortization schedule generators this past weekend, I thought I could do better.  It&#39;s still in-progress, but after (exactly) 2 hours of work, it functions.  View the Amortization schedule generator.  Developed in ASP.NET C#, with a limited amount of JS.  Unlike the site I crashed this weekend, this should tell you if you attempt to pay less per month than you owe in interest.

This release includes menus, the ability to select what data you want in the Xml, and a schema for validation.
Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve discovered one bug (that would have existed before) with playlists getting updated in iTunes, between the refresh in this application, and the time it was clicked on.

For better or worse, when I began setting up my iPod I opted to manually organize my iPod. In large part, this was because at the time I had a machine with a pretty small hard drive, and couldn&#39;t keep all of my music on it.  However, with a new HP, I was able to store all my music on that computer, as well as back it up to a USB drive.

                                Mr. Bruce Springsteen,  While I can&#39;t remember the exact date, or even the year, it was shortly after my parents had divorced, and my father moved out into the country, that I first listened to Born in the U.S.A.; it was one of my father&#39;s old tapes. Now, I really wonder that I didn&#39;t wear that old tape out.  I was pre-teen, and living in northern Wisconsin, and raised Catholic,&nbsp;so not all of the lyrics made sense (not that I really thought about them all that much outside of remembering the exact order, so I could sing the songs by heart), so in that sense, I certainly was lacking an understanding of what they really meant.

is that when you&#39;re there you can&#39;t even tell
as you move through this life you love so
you could be there and not even know  but you say so what I&#39;m doing just fine
the irony is that it&#39;s all in your mind
and that&#39;s why hell is so vicious and cruel

Playstation 2  Shadow Hearts: From the New World was close to completion .. before I bought an Xbox 360.  Persona 3: Fes still remains to be started, and&nbsp;ditto for Persona 4 ... Yes, I didn&#39;t even start Persona 4. Yes, I know how good reviews said it is.

                                While in college I heard of the Greeks who, when death was near, would throw a party. All the friends of the dying would come together to drink and merry. The dying would slit their wrists and party along with the others, his life spilling out from him all the while.
While I&#39;m sure that in today&#39;s world this would never happen, my hope is that when I die those who know me will celebrate, instead of mourn.

                                A while ago I was reading a thread asking individuals what games they had last played multiple times.  Unfortunately, I actually have a hard time coming up with more than a couple, even though I&#39;m sure I must have played games all the way through when I had more time (id est, in college).  The only two I could think of were Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.

                                Here&#39;s what my answer is:  No, I did the standard Philosophy major with a minor in Humanistic Studies.  In high school I liked doing Web stuff, even though my stuff was *horrible*, but I didn&#39;t want to do that for a career (hard to make a career out of something you love, and still keep that love alive - or so they say).  Originally I was going for Psychology, but I was told that wouldn&#39;t be a good field for me, and my Biology grades were horrid.

                                Mustn&#39;t ... look ... too ... closely ... (already ruined one surprise)  Atlus certainly out-did themselves this time, with the Persona 4 pre-order goody. While I was expecting the &quot;Visual Data&quot; bonus to be large enough to fit behind the game&#39;s case, like the Persona 3 bonus, this one is actually graphic novel sized.  Very nice Atlus, very nice.  And, with reviews like this, looks like we can expect a Persona 5 in the near future.

                                So I did it.  Back on November 17 2007 I purchased a Playstation 3. I had debated, back and forth, the purchase of that versus the Xbox 360.  At the time the Xbox was having quite a few issues, including overheating, power block malfunctions, and the wonderful RROD.  However, as time has gone by, the number of complaints has gone down. Some say that the issues are basically resolved, and you just need to find newer systems.

                                I've been working on a new theme for the site, since around 7 this evening ... and it's&nbsp;finally rolled out.
This is along the lines of what I was thinking a couple weeks ago, but I actually grabbed some ideas from Microsoft's recent KB changes.
This is the first theme I've created that used the widget functionality, and I can honestly say I'm still not that impressed with it.
I still have to add some styles for coding that I add in, once I find a good sample (did I really just use blockquote?

                                Log Parser Plus was updated last night, during the election coverage, with the following changes:    All functions now have descriptions (pulled almost completely from the included help file).     Expressions have been added.     Visit LogParserPlus.com for all of this information, and more, as it becomes available.  (Next addition will be samples for the functions, and the start of a fleshed-out queries listing.

                                Right or wrong, GameStop was in stock and selling pre-orders of LittleBigPlanet today, so I was able to pick up my copy, along with the official guide.  Thus far I&#39;ve gone through four complete areas, and picked up the trophies accordingly.  On only the first level did I actually get a 100% (but not the Ace award), and with the later levels, I had to retry a number of times.

I didn&#39;t go wrong.  Hello LG UX565,
you&#39;re awfully cute.  Sleek and simple,
and oh so light.  You take pictures and video,
and have nice big buttons.  &nbsp;  (If I would have got my phone today, instead of yesterday, it would have been 4 years and 2 months .

Since last year got a bit long, I&#39;m going to break it up a bit. So, this post covers shipping from September 26, 2008, to about halfway through (I&#39;m not there yet, so ...). Plan changes  On 12/10/2008 I moved from the two-unlimited to the one-unlimited plan.

In additon to posting the articles here, I&#39;ll be posting a number of articles to Log Parser Plus in an attempt to make Microsoft&#39;s Log Parser utility that much easier.  The initial focus will be on IIS-related queries, but who knows where it&#39;ll end up.

View the galleries online at http://jamesrskemp.com/gallery/  It only took three days, but I&#39;m pretty happy with how things turned out. I&#39;d really like to have the individual photos display a bit better, but ...

Why I went to college  You go to college once you&#39;re done with high school - unless you&#39;re going straight into the workforce.  At the time I was working at&nbsp;a Culvers, which I enjoyed because of a number of people that I worked with, but I knew that I couldn&#39;t make that my profession.

                                The no checkout thing is weird. Had someone else (a Mac user) not a) told me about the process and b) told me about the store location, I would c) made the purchase online instead, and not gotten exactly what I think I want (/known about my other options) and d) would have been utterly confused about the checkout process :)  But, the two people I spoke with while checking out were extremely friendly, and I was amazed by the quality of the store.

                                After sleeping on it (albeit poorly), I&#39;ve resolved the issue that was stopping production on the new version of my Cross Sums Helper application.  However, I need some help testing.  Download Cross Sums Helper 2.0 - 67 KB (.NET Framework 2.0 or higher is required).  UPDATE: Download Cross Sums Helper 2.1 - 65 KB  If you don&#39;t have .NET Framework (and are on Windows) let me know - I had a hard time finding any real stats on these numbers, even from MS people.

                                 According to commercials yesterday and today, the $5 footlongs at Subway are now a part of the menu. Is anyone really surprised?  While the Subway near where I work is usually very busy during lunch, it seems to be especially so now. This is after they raised the prices of their subs not once, but twice.  On that note, what&#39;s up with The Feast? Seriously.

Five steps;    Copying Windows files     Gathering files     Expanding files     Installing features and updates     Completing upgrade     What&#39;s initially scary is the &quot;Your upgrade may take several hours to complete.

                                Yesterday afternoon I took digital photo number 10,000.
Between the three digital cameras that I've owned (and excluding the one that I borrowed from my sister, which was&nbsp;a gift from her friend Char), I've taken the following.
From April 6 2005 to May 9 2007, I took 2924 photos with a Canon 300D (Digital Rebel).
From May 18 2007 to March 29 2008, I took 6447 photos with a Canon Digital Rebel XT (350D).

                                Recently, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about where I&#39;d like to be when I get older.  For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve been thinking ahead - it&#39;s just the way I am. The time frame has spanned from a mere hours from the present, to a number of years. Thirty (30), though, is a pretty special kind of birthday. The fact that it&#39;s about 3 years and 3 months away for me, makes it even particularly more so.

                                Yes, I&#39;m still alive, I&#39;m just not posting ...  Since Friday I&#39;ve been fighting a cold/flu, and the cold weather hasn&#39;t much helped. However, last Saturday morning I was feeling better, and along with lunch, picked up a camera I&#39;ll be writing about once this cold is dead.  Another camera? I&#39;ve still got my Canon 350D, but I haven&#39;t used it since it&#39;s gotten so cold. I decided that if I picked up a point-and-shoot camera I&#39;d probably take more pictures.

                                Right before Christmas of 2007, I purchased a copy of Warhawk, for the Playstation 3. I didn't pick it up until the day after Christmas (what a bad idea; I should have just purchased in store, but ...) and have played a mere 16 hours (94 games).
With my total points of 1153, I'm only 113315 out of the 410195 players, world wide. Granted, that's not too terribly bad, but I need to make a goal if I'm going to apply myself.

                                The other day, after a deal of research, I decided to pick up a copy of &lt;oXygen/&gt;, which&nbsp;is &quot;a complete cross platform XML editor providing the tools for XML authoring, XML conversion, XML Schema, DTD, Relax NG and Schematron development, XPath, XSLT, XQuery debugging, SOAP and WSDL testing.&quot;  This provided to be the key to finally understanding XML Schema, or at least getting a working Schema for an XML file.

                                A while ago, I posted a link to an XML file that contained my vehicle's gas information.
Since my vehicle recently turned over its 10,000 mile,&nbsp;I figured it was time to post the link again.

                                Years and years ago I was young. My father had moved out of his parent&#39;s house by this time (meaning the time I&#39;m recollecting on), and had possibly lived at at least one other place.  Anyways, he ended up living at my Uncle Pat&#39;s place. I don&#39;t recall the first couple of visits to the place, but I remember the place well enough. Recollections of the place itself will have to wait, though, since that&#39;s not what I wanted to speak about.

                                 A while back, I ended up recording a number of my pieces using the free Audacity software. However, the files soon disappeared from the Web.  These have been added to the respective posts, and are once again available for download.  Use the listen tag to find the articles. At this time, it looks like there are just three, but more will be added.

                                Updated for BlogEngine.NET 1.3!
 Not a very original name, but I can see how it was created &hellip;
Anyways, I&rsquo;m proud to present another theme for BlogEngine.NET, called MWRT-002.
This theme is based upon the template of the same name by MyWebResource, and made available on Open Source Web Design.
A zip of the theme can be downloaded from my testing site at JamesRSkemp.net.
Download the zip file - for BlogEngine.

                                It&#39;s definitely a form email, with some major spacing issue. However, the email itself is pretty concise and to the point.  ColdFusion development, in California. I like the first line, &quot;It is time to come out and join the rest of the people escaping the cold.&quot; but they clearly don&#39;t know me. If anything, I&#39;ll move further north :D  Thankfully, I&#39;m pretty happy where I am now, although it looks like I&#39;ll be pulling in a deal of extra hours this week.

The name comes from the purple flowers (taken outside of Madison Wisconsin&#39;s capitol building (see the Galleries for more shots) and that purple usually signifies royalty, or richness.  I&#39;m not sure that the left-side navigation has been done the best it could be, but ... overall I&#39;m pretty happy with it.

                                I had previously written on how Netflix shipped and received DVDs, for Madison WI. This article continues that one, by discussing Year 2 with Netflix (first year began September 26, 2006). Plan changes  On December 2, 2007, I decided to upgrade to the two at-a-time (unlimited)&nbsp;plan. Since my plan begins on the 10th of each month, that means I had to pay an extra $1.26 to upgrade now, instead of for the next month (I figure this way they&#39;ll send a movie out tomorrow morning).

                                Yes, that's right, my worst fear has come true. Not only did I get a girl pregnant, she also had my baby and is spelling my name wrong.
Or, when I signed up for something online, they must have thought that I have a child. Or, Mr. James Skamp had a child.
I guess my child is about 12 months old now - I don't know if it's walking yet though - but Huggies seems to think it's using diapers (hence the coupons).

                                On July 7, of this year, I went to the farmer&#39;s market off of the Capitol square, in Madison. I picked up some sunflowers and a bunch of flowers. I ended up taking a number of pictures before the flowers eventually died, and the picture I used for the new header image is one of those taken.  The file size for the image is rather large, in my opinion, but with today&#39;s speeds, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.

                                I&#39;ve never been to New York City, at least, not that I can recall. However, media has, for various reasons, touched upon the city in a number of formats, in a number of ways, for a number of years. Without having ever been to New York City, I can say the following about it.  Stay out of New York City. Common wisdom is right, New Yorkers are less human than people in other cities.

                                At approximately 2:30 Sunday afternoon a Pepsi Ball was spotted around 10 Market St in San Francisco. The Ball, which eventually killed Noah Ridge, 27, continued on it's rampage in the area, striking multiple vehicles.
By the time the rolling rampage was over, $250,000 in property damages, 20 injured, and a nation lies in shock.
At the time of this article, Pepsi Co. refused to return our calls.
Our assesement? Pepsi, fitting its marketing, once again show contempt for those outside of its shareholders.

                                I had occasion today to read The Hospice, by Robert Aickman (1914-1980). This story was in the collection Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (selected by Marvin Kaye).  Unfortunately, I had to go to Google to try to make sense of the story, since Kaye himself suggests that the meaning is rather obscure.  A simple G search turned up a result at some site, which itself is rather odd .

Update 8/16/2008: This theme should work fine on BlogEngine.NET 1.4.5 or lower, using the 1.3 link.
 I&rsquo;m proud to present a theme for BlogEngine.NET (tested with 1.1) called Swan Dive.
This theme is based upon the template of the same name by Homefront Studios, and made available on Open Source Web Design.
While this is technically my third theme for BlogEngine.NET, it&rsquo;s the first for public consumption.

                                I had the &#39;opportunity&#39; today to import a WordPress blog from one server to another. While WordPress 2.2.x no comes with built-in functionality to export, and then import, an XML file, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s anything but simple and trustworthy.  It seems that there may be a built-in limit to the amount of posts that can be imported. For me, I had to do an initial import (the XML file was approximately 2.

Find out more at www.dotnetblogengine.net/  Now that 1.1 has been released, I&#39;m going to be actively looking at theme creation; I&#39;ve got mine, of course, but I&#39;ve got some ideas for others as well.

                                I&#39;ve almost completed converting the WordPress theme to a BlogEngine.NET theme.  The only hard part is when BlogEngine.NET (or ASP.NET) restricts write access to the CSS file. In these cases I have to tweak the CSS file using Firebug. It&#39;s a bit of a chore, since BlogEngine.NET compresses the CSS file so much (which is a good thing, in the long term), but since I&#39;m also changing the file locally in Dreamweaver, it&#39;s just a matter of copying and pasting (over the Firebug CSS content).

                                With a new host, comes a unique move.  Previously I was using WordPress, since I was hosted on a Linux (shared) server. Fortunately, I&#39;ve decided to move to a Windows VPS, since the month of June was full of either slow down, or completely down, times. Since I don&#39;t want to install PHP and MySQL (which I would want to pay for the external dbs anyway), I&#39;ve decided to switch my content out of WordPress.

                                After a good number of years, I&#39;ve finally got new glasses ...  I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve had my previous frames, but I believe I put two different lenses into them. Part of the reason is I don&#39;t care too much about my glasses - I just want glasses that work.  So, I went to Lenscrafters and worked with Candace (sp?), and with some assistance from my sister, I picked up two pairs; one pair of regular, and one pair of sunglasses.

                                ... I&#39;m not an Ubuntu-only user yet (unlike some people I know).&nbsp; Granted, I like using it, since I&#39;ve believed, for some time, that if you want to run Apache, you can&#39;t really run it on Windows ...  (Granted, I&#39;m having a really difficult time trying to stick to my guns with Apache, versus IIS, but ... well, more on that in the future.)  I will probably blow this current box away and re-install Ubuntu, without the Windows partition, and doing a lot more building from source, for example, for Firefox.

After a bit of looking around, for the best gallery application, I&#39;ve settled on SlideShowPro. While it does require Flash (version 7 or higher, but I&#39;m requiring version 8 or higher for mine), and it did cost some money, it&#39;s a great little application.

I was reading an article the other day, which was discussing a companies backup plan. It&#39;s suicidal for companies, in this day and age, <em>not</em> to have some kind of backup plan in place (and, most importantly, tested). Yet, for home users, especially those with important documents on their computers, it&#39;s almost approaching suicidal.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s ways to do these backups by burning to CD or DVD, of course, and even Windows seems to have something built in (or at least my HP computer with a DVD-burner does), but you actually have to run the utility, and put a disc in the drive.<!--adsense-->

WordPress 2.1 was released today and, unfortunately, I&#39;m just not horribly impressed by the new feature list.&nbsp; Granted, it&#39;s a short feature list, but I see few reasons to upgrade.&nbsp; The main reason?&nbsp; Most of these features look like they&#39;re geared towards non-technical/shared-hosting users.

There&#39;s a number of problems with WordPress, as far as accessibility goes.  However, the easiest one to fix is the problem with the calendar, which displays in the default theme, as well as many custom ones (I&#39;m sure).  It lacks a summary tag.

                                There&#39;s a handful of guides out there that list the available loot in Final Fantasy XII (for the Playstation 2). However, none of the ones that I&#39;ve seen collect the information in a form that&#39;s both printer friendly, and in a format that makes checking things off simple.  To that effect, I&#39;ve created a five page PDF that allows you to easily check of the number of loot you&#39;ve sold, and what you&#39;ve left to find.

                                For the past couple days I&#39;ve noticed a rash of fake user account&#39;s being created.&nbsp; I wonder if this isn&#39;t meant to be some new way to possibly exploit WordPress.  I&#39;ve kept the original emails I received from WordPress, and am very tempted to delete the accounts.&nbsp; However, WordPress only seems to allow the deletion of accounts.&nbsp; What if I want to &#39;ban&#39; an account/username/email?  I suppose I&#39;ll have to go find a plugin, or build one myself.

                                As stated in another post, Netflix shipping, for Madison WI, I decided to give Netflix a try.&nbsp; I&#39;m still with them, and I&#39;ve watched a number of movies, that I may otherwise have had to purchase or rent elsewhere.  For a limited time, you too can try Netflix for free.&nbsp; Go to www.netflix.com and enter the code of Friend63.&nbsp; This offer expires on June 30, 2006, but I do hope that means June 2007 .

                                There&#39;s a very cool interactive map for the University of Wisconsin Madison campus. You can see it at map.wisc.edu.  In other news, hopefully I&#39;ll have some photos of my new car, a 2007 VW Rabbit that was built just for me.&nbsp; My previous car was a 1987 VW Golf, which makes my new car 20 years newer.&nbsp; Not too bad for my second car.  With just a little luck (not very much at all), the Rabbit should last 20 years as well.

                                Duh.  Unfortunately, much like Google Video, you can get sucked into the program and end up spending hours (2 and a half in my case) goofing around, getting nothing of real value done. Of course, that begs the question of whether experience, as experience, is of any value. Do we, simply by experiencing, benefit? I suppose when it comes to use a technology, like Photoshop, any experience is a good experience.

                                So, the Isthmus picked up my post on Netflix.&nbsp; That&#39;s very nice of them (I wonder how it was picked up?).&nbsp; In the course of looking over the Isthmus&#39; site, I noticed another post title &quot;Dear City of Madison&quot; Ouch. Reading his post first, and his profile second (which included his location), the title of this post came to mind.  Years ago, when both my sister and I were living at home, we&#39;d fight, as siblings under one roof and with only one TV, often do.

Yesterday, I did multiple takes for a video on how to create snippets in Dreamweaver 8. The video ended up being pretty good, I think, albeit the video size was a bit large, and the resolution was a bit small (640x480 is what Google recommends).

                                Version control is something that I've been interested in for the past several months (actually, what month is it, September? I guess it's been longer than just a couple of months) but that I haven't been able to dig into as much as I'd like.
Subversion keeps coming up as a good piece of software, with the addition of Trac. Since I wrote the guide to installing Apache 2.0.x a bit ago, I have no reason for not getting started with Subversion.

I&#39;ll be needing to get a new Playstation 2 memory card shortly, since the I&#39;ve got less than a MB left on each of the two cards I currently have. While there&#39;s some extra Final Fantasy X saves that I could go through and delete, I&#39;d really like to backup the saves that I have to my computer. After a bit of searching, I&#39;m just not sure what to purchase ...

If you haven&#39;t tried it out yet, I recommend you do so.&nbsp; My results from Charter, in Madison WI, are below.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see just how long this stays up.

I just figured out a problem I was having connecting to the Internet yesterday, so today it&#39;s been browsing browsing browsing.

I also just grabbed last month&#39;s stats (from AWStats) for my site, and hooked up Google Analytics (having grabbed an invite from the Digital Point forums - to quote Gavin, &quot;woot&quot;).  Looking at browser stats in particular (from AWStats - Analytics won&#39;t be functional until tomorrow), I noticed a couple of things.<!--adsense-->

For the past hour, I&#39;ve been looking at current ways to get my name out there for Web page cleanup and commenting.  In other words, I&#39;d like to work with existing code to bring it closer to the standards, and comment it, if necessary.  I would think it would be of great benefit to those individuals who bought a solution from a vendor, and are looking at changes to that code, or cleanup so that there pages act alike in most browsers.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t found a site to offer my wares.  I&#39;ve also looked at open source projects that may need some free help, but, alas, nothing there either.

We had some minor-major flooding on my house&#39;s closest intersection.  Three cars got stuck - mid-sized vehicles like a Toyota Avalon (?).  All three got pushed out of the water, but all three weren&#39;t turning over any more.  Tomorrow morning I&#39;ll know how bad mine is.<!--adsense-->

My first shot at installing Debian didn&#39;t go quite so well.  I&#39;m attempting to install on a HP Pavilion XE734, using pretty much the base system.  One addition appears to be a 3Com Fast Etherlink PCI card, from the late 90s ... (3C595-TX).<!--adsense-->

                                Thanks to some great service yesterday, I&#39;ve successfully logged into my Vault again, and am seeing actual data. I have a day and a half of data, but I&#39;m already quite impressed with the user interface. I&#39;m also extremely impressed by the feedback I&#39;ve received from individuals involved in the project.  This is definitely something that I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how it develops in the near future. They&#39;ve definitely hit on something big.

There&#39;s a handful of extensions for Firefox that I found absolutely necessary in my day-to-day Web production and development. Below, I&#39;ve outlined the essentials, as well as those that are near the top of the crop.

<p>
Please note that my current setup is Windows, with Firefox 1.5.0.2. After each extension, I&#39;ve listed the current version, at the time of this writing. I cannot speak for any versions before or after those listed.

                                Last night, I was working through a great tutorial that steps through how to create a basic XML parser in PHP. Unfortunately, what I was going to use it for (a local Attention Recorder parser) isn't going to be possible, since the extension's XML isn't quite valid.
I was hoping to at least get /ROOT Vaults to work today, in that case, but no dice on support.&nbsp; So, I'll be attempting to reset my password once again, in the hope that it was just a two day problem .

                                If my last post got you interested in the AttentionTrust project, and you downloaded the extension, are using it now, and are reading this on StrivingLife.net (whew, lot&#39;s of &#39;if&#39;s), then you may have noticed that StrivingLife.net is now a certified member.&nbsp; What does that mean for you?  First, that I agree with four principles that the AttentionTrust organization puts forward;   1. Property : You own your attention and can store it wherever you wish.

Being able to look at the statistics for a couple of different sites, with very different audiences, I&#39;ve found one common thread, which is quite alarming.  Before you go any further, it has to do with bots and search engines, so if you&#39;re not interested in either, you can probably safely skip this post.

                                For work today, I sent off an email to support for a product that we purchased, FusionReactor (an application for helping analyze/debug ColdFusion).  About an hour later, one of their support members called me up and talked me through the answers to the questions I had raised.&nbsp; He also went above and beyond what I had asked by digging deeper into what we were looking for, and even went so far as to suggest that we could send on some log files for them to peruse.

                                Since I've got a couple more days worth of tutorials already written, and since things are now going relatively smoothly (I had a couple of problems with the MySQL implementation as a whole), I figured I would give an update to what I've been doing, and what I will be doing.
Tonight, I'll be posting the tutorial on getting PHP up and running.&nbsp; Within a day, or maybe two, of doing that, I'll be walking through the installation of MySQL and phpMyAdmin.

Starting this week (hopefully), I&#39;ll be writing a number of posts detailing how to go about doing these installations, with the express purpose of creating an environment for the testing of Web pages, or the learning of HTML/PHP/ColdFusion.<!--adsense-->

                                In January, looking at the number of pages that were viewed, around 63% of visitors used Internet Explorer to access a page on the StrivingLife.net Network, while 26% used Firefox.&nbsp; After that, about 3.5% used Safari, followed by 2.9% using Mozilla and 2.2% using Opera.&nbsp; Netscape?&nbsp; 1.4%.  Of course, the Firefox numbers give it away pretty well - we cater to a more technologically literate group than the Internet as a whole.

Over the coming months, you&#39;ll notice that the size of this area will increase.  I&#39;ll be adding a number of older articles to this area (articles from http://strivinglife.net/articles/) in the interest of creating both a standard, as well as making articles easier to find.  Since they&#39;ll be post-dated (new articles will not, of course), they won&#39;t be crowding out any current posts.<!--adsense-->

So, I guess I lied about the upgrade to WordPress 2.0, as I just finished doing it. Doesn&#39;t look like one of the old plug-ins is going to work yet, but since I don&#39;t use it ...

                                I&#39;m looking for ideas on what I can write in PHP and MySQL.&nbsp; Thus far, I&#39;ve written:  1) A comments system, that still gets hit by spam (but don&#39;t they all?).  2) An admin interface to upload documents, then create a record in a database for display elsewhere (along with categories and related articles/documents).  I just don&#39;t know - what do I *need* for functionality?&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll look further into creating a RSS reader - I just don&#39;t know .

Thanks to my sister still being in school, I&#39;ve been able to pick up a number of very powerful commercial tools for fairly cheap.  I&#39;m big on free programs - Open Source being the key word these days - but sometimes the professional&#39;s tools are just more than all that.<!--adsense-->

On November 9, Gavin&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://framingbusiness.net/&quot;&gt;FramingBusiness.net&lt;/a&gt; went live with a new feature: functionality to collect, store, and display comments.&nbsp; Any article posted since June of 2005 will have this functionality, and many old ones, that have been converted over to PHP and the new layout, will also have this functionality.

                                After a good deal of thought, I&#39;ve realized that philosophy in my life has decreased a good deal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had the time to think about philosophy as much as I&#39;d like.  For those reasons, I&#39;ll be focusing on both technology, as a site admin, as well as philosophy (as a philosopher).  I&#39;ll add the appropriate categorizations so that it will be semi-easy to switch between the two.

                                Today I&#39;ll be talking about how the StrivingLife.net network runs.  In my opinion, you can break the network down into two large parts; my computer and my host&#39;s computer.&nbsp; There are certainly other things that come into play, such as the Internet in general, and the support of Google and the sites that it brings up in the various searches I (need to) do, but they are (almost) always applicable when you talk about the Internet.

First, let&#39;s talk about the StrivingLife.net network.
</p>
<p>
To do that, we&#39;ll have to talk about how I got to this point.

After a good deal of thought, most of it sub-conscious, I have decided what it is that I&#39;ll be doing with this WordPress, or &#39;blog&#39;.
</p>
<p>
It took a while, as one will notice by looking at the old posts - it took a great while.  Yet, I believe the wait will have given this a great purpose.

                                No update in a while, so ...  1) If you say that Clinton&#39;s My Life has 1000 pages (pretty close to that), then I&#39;m 28.6% of the way through right now.&nbsp; I&#39;m about to shut off the computer and read for the rest of the night, which means that I may even be over 30% of the way (35%?) done by the night&#39;s end.  What this means is that I&#39;ll finally give Gavin a real idea of what I think about the book.

                                The following was written from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002, but I am just now (January 30, 2009) getting around to posting this.  I can honestly admit that I haven&#39;t read over this in a very long time, but the skimming that I have done reminds me of certain things ... As time progresses I may go back and re-purpose this content.  (Of particular note, also, will be at what time these were written and when I was reading certain philosophical works.
