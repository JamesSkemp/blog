Since I&#39;m not going to be able to write the article(s) that I wanted to tonight (since one is going to require research, and the other is going to involve thought) I figure I&#39;ll write up a quick review on The Departed, which I had the pleasure of seeing today.<!--more-->

	The Departed is quite easily the best film of 2006 that I&#39;ve seen. Take that however you wish. (<a href="http://framingbusiness.net/">Gavin Schmitt</a>, via email, October 20 2006)

I don&#39;t think Gavin thought I was going to quote him, but, I think we both know that anything we say via email is fair game (with a few exceptions). Anyways, I think Gavin hit it on the nose.

The first thing I have to comment on is the audience that was with me. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen a movie in a theatre so close to when it was first released. Usually, I see movies a month or so after they&#39;ve been out (id est, a week or so before they leave the theatre). I&#39;ve been waiting for The Departed since I first saw the trailer on tv, so I didn&#39;t want to wait that long this time.
</p>
<p>
In the theatre, there were initially a lot of women. Now, keep in mind that I saw the movie on Sunday, at the 1 pm showing. This means that not only was the movie $4, it&#39;s early Sunday morning. After a while, couples started filtering in, followed by a rather large group of obnoxious teen/college students, who thankfully shut the _ up (&#39;cause I was certainly going to shush them in an aggressive tone if they had not when the movie started).
</p>
<p>
So, overall, an audience that I was not expecting.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, the cast. There&#39;s a whole lot of A-list talent in this movie, and it shows. Overall, I don&#39;t think anyone did less than their best in this film. Not only that, but they&#39;ve picked exactly the right people for <em>every</em> part. Sometimes you think about what an actor has done before, what parts they&#39;ve played, and it changes how you think about the character that they&#39;re playing. Yet, in this movie, the few times I thought about, which was mainly after the fact, it seemed that they were being conditioned to play their part in this movie.
</p>
<p>
Not only is this a &#39;watch in the theatre&#39; movie, this is also a &#39;buy it when it comes out on DVD&#39; flick. Your mileage may vary, but I completely enjoyed the movie - with absolutely no exceptions. The movie is violent, but before you know it it&#39;s over - there&#39;s little sustained violence during this movie.
