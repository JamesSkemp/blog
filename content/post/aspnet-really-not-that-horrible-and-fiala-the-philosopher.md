No posts since April - ouch. But, I&#39;ve been a busy guy.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
First off, we&#39;ve got Fiala&#39;s book <cite class="book">Practical Pacifism</cite> (2004). More will be said about this book in <a href="/words/post/Review-of-Andrew-Fialas-Practical-Pacifism.aspx">the review</a> that I&#39;ll be writing, but it&#39;s been grabbing up as much as my free time as it can since the 1st of May (yes, it&#39;s been a slow reading on my part, but I have been busy, remember).<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Then we&#39;ve got some ASP.NET reading, particularly with C#. After my limited experience with ASP (regular old), I didn&#39;t care for the language, especially after working with ColdFusion primarily. However, .NET appears to actually have it&#39;s act together. Many of the things that .NET is discussing are concepts I&#39;m already familiar with because of ColdFusion (which other languages don&#39;t share - like a common file that is called before every request, built into the language - Application.cfc in ColdFusion, for example). I&#39;ve already got a number of ideas of how to use the language, which is good, because you have to use it to learn it ...

<p>
Along with this, I&#39;ve been working with Microsoft&#39;s Visual Web Developer (the Express Edition). Unfortunately, I keep switching back to Dreamweaver, since I really like how DW treats my code. It looks like there&#39;s settings in VWD to format my code how I like, in some cases, but not all. For example - if I hit Tab, insert a tab, not spaces. If I want my brackets on the same line as my function name, then leave them there - not some of the time, <em>all</em> of the time.

<p>
Anyways, more on all of that later.

Then I&#39;ve got some freelance work that&#39;s taking up my evenings and that I&#39;ve been working on this weekend. There&#39;s an older job which had been sitting, but which is now picking up steam.
</p>
<p>
All of this has combined to make my free time considerably shorter. And to this the fact that I picked up some PS2 games, and I&#39;ve been playing them when I can, and I&#39;ve filled up my free time, which means no additional questions for Gavin, yet, and no photos to Nick, yet (or printed out for my mom).
</p>
<p>
Finally, it&#39;s been nice as of late - not hot and sticky yet, save one day - so I&#39;ve been trying to get out and get some pictures taken. It&#39;s raining today, or I&#39;d try to head out again, especially since I&#39;ve just picked up some money for another job, and will be getting more money on Monday, so I&#39;ll be picking up a new lens for my camera (finally!). As with the above, more on this later (read: Monday or Tuesday, if not tonight, for this particular item).
