I was trying to pass some time, and came upon Adventures in Linux - Episode I, on Google Video.  While the top 100 is full of material of little lasting value, it&#39;s nice to see the 1-2% of content that actually serves a purpose.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

For example, Stanford&#39;s famous prison experiment is available through G Video.  Likewise, I think <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6347380926653203943" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Adventures In Linux</a> is another beneficial video.

While I&#39;ll bash most Web 2.0, social networking sites, Google continues to be the forerunner of good uses, even if the masses must plague the site with that which graces the top of most lists; dig in, and you&#39;ll find the pearls.

I&#39;ve thought about doing something similar myself, using some of my guides for inspiration, and probably will after I&#39;ve moved in the coming days.
