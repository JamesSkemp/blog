I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie. Other editions may play differently, although since I don&#39;t discuss the audio or video components of this film, my review will stand as-is.

This is, by far, one of the most wonderful films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.

While I haven&#39;t been much of a Will Ferrell fan in the past, this movie has truly opened my eyes to just how great of an actor he really is. I&#39;m ashamed to admit that this may have actually been the major reason that I didn&#39;t watch this film before now.

Dustin Hoffman, like his role in I Heart Huckabees, seems a perfect fit in the important role he plays. Maggie Gyllenhaal, often seen in a negative light, for whatever reason, is absolutely beautiful in her role.

What would you do if you were Harold Crick? Does Harold Crick&#39;s story lead some meaning to our own?
