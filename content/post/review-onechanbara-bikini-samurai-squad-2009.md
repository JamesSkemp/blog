<h3>Ignore the cover, Onechanbara actually isn't that bad</h3>
<p>Honestly, I hesitated bringing this up to the counter to pay for it.&nbsp;However, with the 3-point-something rating, new copies selling for over $60, and the store having it used for $6.30, I had to pick up Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad.</p>
<p>I'll admit it, as I guy who likes girls sex can get me to purchase something, and Onechanbara certainly promises that. However, under that exterior lies a fairly good hack-and-slash game. It's certainly not as complex as other games in the genre, but it sucked up at least 18 and a half hours of my time over the last couple weeks, and I can certainly see myself popping it in to try to unlock a few more achievements.</p>
<p>Right or wrong, at times the game seemed to remind me of <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/post/Review-Bullet-Witch-2006-Xbox-360.aspx">Bullet Witch</a>. However, Bullet Witch is extremely quick, a third-person shooter, with much simpler gameplay. However, the developers certainly spent more time on the main characters than on any of the non-female enemies.</p>
<p>Story-wise Bullet Witch is actually fairly good, while when I was playing&nbsp;Onechanbara I felt like I was really missing out having this be the first game in the series I've played.</p>
<p>Button-mashing and grinding will get you past the main story, but a certain skill is definitely required to master the game.</p>
<p>It's no Dynasty Warriors,&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sengoku-Basara-Samurai-Heroes-Playstation-3/dp/B002X9KYFW?tag=strivinglifen-20">Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drakengard-Playstation-2/dp/B0001A86EG?tag=strivinglifen-20">Drakengard</a>, Devil May Cry, or <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bayonetta-Xbox-360/dp/B001YI0Z2U?tag=strivinglifen-20">Bayonetta</a>, (or perhaps even <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fist-North-Star-Kens-Playstation-3/dp/B003NSECVY?tag=strivinglifen-20">Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage</a>) but&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Onechanbara-Bikini-Samurai-Squad-Xbox-360/dp/B001EOQV9U?tag=strivinglifen-20">Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad</a> shouldn't simply be overlooked because of the cover.</p>
<p>3 of 5 stars. Ultimately, I'm glad I picked this up. At 18+ hours I certainly got my money's worth and I'll play it again. But there's better games in this genre.</p>
