<p>For various reasons, I had need to install Windows XP on a new virtual machine earlier today (with Windows 7&nbsp;64-bit&nbsp;as the host).</p>
<p>For whatever reason, when getting to the point of accepting the licensing terms, before installation, I was unable to&nbsp;use the F8 key. After searching about,&nbsp;I found&nbsp;a number of Mac and Ubuntu users with the same issue, but no Windows users. The left control, shift, alt, and even right control (which I knew wasn't going to work, but an Ubuntu user swore by it and I was out of options) buttons did nothing to help.</p>
<p>However, the often-used (ah, sarcasm) "F Lock" key was what finally did it.</p>
<p>But what the heck if the F Lock key in the first place? <a rel="external" href="http://jtsang.mvps.org/flock.html">Turns out</a> it's a Microsoft keyboard key, and which seems utterly useless.</p>
<p>Did the presence of this key cause the issue? Or is this a common issue that Windows users don't report? Or were the Mac/Linux questions so plentiful that they bumped the Windows users?</p>
