<ul>
	<li>I heard you talking</li>
	<li>just the other day.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You talked like Aphrodite,</li>
	<li>that damned goddess of old,</li>
	<li>You were talking in her ear</li>
	<li>and it made me feel so cold...</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I would give you all the attention,</li>
	<li>perhaps more then you could hold,</li>
	<li>I&#39;d put my heart on the block,</li>
	<li>and not expect a &#39;thunk&#39;.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do you hurt me on purpose?</li>
	<li>Did those before?</li>
	<li>I&#39;m not an artist,</li>
	<li>but I&#39;ve a bleeding heart...</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When you are not about</li>
	<li>I curse the ground you tread.</li>
	<li>When you are around me</li>
	<li>I wish for ground beneath my feet.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>But you are a woman,</li>
	<li>and that explains all...</li>
</ul>
