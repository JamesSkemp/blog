The following is a review of One Week Ultimate Werewolf, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Still Just Too Random
[One Week Ultimate Werewolf][review] isn't my first game of the series, having played many of the One Night variants in the past. However, those have never really clicked with me, as they've felt just way too random.

In this variant we have a box much larger than the One Night versions, with many additional components. The box itself has quite the heft since the round discs are each quite heavy. Cards and rooms look great, and the manual is a nice large size, with a number of pages due to how many pictures they displayed within. Definitely a game with high quality components (although no insert means things just move around during transportation).

One Week Ultimate Werewolf is a social deduction game, where you're trying to figure out who, if anyone, is the werewolf/ves. To do this you'll move your character, and possibly the staff, to different rooms, and then during the night phase each player will perform some action to look at or move tokens. While I was hoping One Week would feel better than the One Night versions, it instead just feels like I have less control over things, and I'm playing a more complex version of One Night, with less portability.

I just didn't find myself enjoying the game. If I found myself in a large enough group I'd either play [Ultimate Werewolf][uw] for the theme and high player counts, or [The Resistance][tr] for a smaller player count/a social deducation game done right.

For the reasons above, I give [One Week Ultimate Werewolf][review] a neutral three of five stars. If you enjoy the One Night variants you might enjoy this. If you didn't like the One Night variants then look elsewhere.
