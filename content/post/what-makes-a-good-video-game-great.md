<p>
A while ago I was reading a thread asking individuals what games they had last played multiple times.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I actually have a hard time coming up with more than a couple, even though I&#39;m sure I must have played games all the way through when I had more time (id est, in college).
</p>
<p>
The only two I could think of were Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.
</p>
<p>
I played Uncharted, from beginning to end, three times.&nbsp;The third time was because trophy support had been added in, and I wanted the trophies for what I&#39;d already been able to accomplish before.
</p>
<p>
Metal Gear Solid 4 I did an initial play, doing whatever I felt like (and eventually what the game finally beat into me as how I shoiuld play if I wanted to finish it), and one more with zero kills.
</p>
<p>
I believe I played through Final Fantasy VII twice, as I first purchased and played the PC version, and then the Playstation version. While I think I finished the PC version, I can&#39;t recall for certain (but I&#39;m almost positive I did).
</p>
<p>
I started a second playthrough of Final Fantasy X-2, but I only got a little way in before I got wrapped up with other things.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried to play FF8 and FF9 a number of times, but never stuck with it long enough, which could also be said for a handful of other games.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, it was the story that really drove me on in both Uncharted and MGS4; I played them and didn&#39;t get sick of them.
</p>
<p>
Now there&#39;s other games that I&#39;ve picked back up, after &#39;beating&#39; them, such as FFXII, Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari (although not so much the latter), LittleBigPlanet, and way back when, Super Mario World and Mario 64. (And I&#39;m very tempted to play through the first Shadow Hearts again, because I remember loving it when I first played it, because of the story and gameplay.)
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, then, it is the story that really makes a game worth it to me, in that I want to go through the game again.
</p>
<p>
I was lent Bioshock, and I think that may take another spot in this short list (although whether it&#39;s the 360 or PS3 version that takes it, depends upon time).
</p>
<p>
My only hope is that Uncharted 2 and Bioshock 2, not to mention some game among all those other games that will be out between now and the former, will be a part of this list as well ...
