<p>Description: Script of the movie <em>Waking Life</em>, based on Tara Carreon's transcription, but with revisions based upon a viewing of the DVD version of the movie, which was watched with subtitles.</p>
<p>Notes: Special thanks to Andrew, Larry Redden, and Ed Sandberg for pointing out errors in Tara's transcription (numerous errors were fixed here, along with some scene information clarifications). Absolutely let me know if anything slipped by my look-over, especially in the quicker and the 'like, like, you know,' sections ;)</p>

<p>(The Tosca Tango orchestra is rehearsing in a house)</p>
<p>Rock out. Rock and roll. Go strings. Begin. Sara, will you try that, the thing you asked me about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Will you try it a little more subdued?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Vibrato. Just try it and see what you think. But what I want - I mean, I want it to sound rich and maybe almost a little wavy due to being slightly out of tune.</p>
<p>Do you want it, um -</p>
<p>I think it should be slightly detached.</p>
<p>That's what I was wondering.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>Okay, pick up to 20, please.</p>
