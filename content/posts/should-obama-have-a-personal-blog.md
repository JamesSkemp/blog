<p>
I work at the State Bar of Wisconsin, the membership of which elects a president every year. (Technically they elect a president-elect, but that&#39;s moot.)
</p>
<p>
One of the things my co-workers and I (<a href="http://rmlumley.com/">Rob</a> and <a href="http://mrrofl.com/">Dan</a>) bounced off each other was a blog for the president-elect, for the three years they serve (president-elect, president, and outgoing (?)).
</p>
<p>
With the Obama administration, I wonder if the time of weekly addresses is out, and the time of a more timely blog is in. (Obviously, had Palin been elected, this wouldn&#39;t even be an issue, which is pretty scary.)
</p>
<p>
Not only could this serve as a more personal look into the White House, but also into our President.
</p>
<p>
Granted, he has a number of other &#39;Web 2.0&#39;/social networking outlets, but these aren&#39;t directly run by Obama. And of course, a blog probably wouldn&#39;t be him directly filling it in either, but ... he may at least generate the ideas and feelings behind it.
</p>
<p>
Could it be possible? Looking ahead, when would we see another who actually stands a chance of being the first?
