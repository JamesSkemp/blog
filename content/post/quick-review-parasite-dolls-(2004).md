<p>
With over 6 hours left of instant watching time left, all that needs to be used before the 10th of the month, it was time for another movie ...
</p>
<p>
This time it was the 2004 film Parasite Dolls. I knew nothing of the film before I watched it.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	In this anime adventure, androids with knock-out bodies and personalities have 
	begun to take over every area of society. Known as Boomers, these 
	stellar-looking beings begin to show that some are as un-human as you can get, 
	and when their infiltration becomes too much to take, peacekeeper Branch must 
	step in to make things right. But when some faulty Boomers start killing 
	innocent people, will there be enough time to stop them all?

Quite honestly, the Netflix description is pretty far off, but ...
</p>
<p>
From the previously mentioned description one might begin thinking of <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/ghost-in-the-shell-2-innocence-script/">Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</a>, where something rather similar to this happens. There&#39;s also an episode in the series (the first season I believe) where we also have such a situation. You&#39;ve also got &quot;puppet MASTER,&quot; which is an obvious tilt of the hat.
</p>
<p>
***SPOILER - Beginning***
</p>
<p>
Anyways, it turns out that it&#39;s a particular series which is going berserk, and that human beings are also taking some out for a joy-ride, getting off on the transmitted experience (see also Strange Days). 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s part one.
</p>
<p>
In part two we have the boomers being killed off, which turns out to be something like a cover-up / assassination.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in part three, we have a &#39;politician&#39; (or would-be?) who is determined to destory not only all boomers, but also cripple/destroy the production facilities.
</p>
<p>
***SPOILER - End***
</p>
<p>
Like Ghost in the Shell, and Blade Runner, we clearly have a questioning of what human is. As is suggested in the third part, if we create machines for our own use, and those machines cannot feel pain or anguish, can we destroy those machines? If something does not live, can we destroy it?
</p>
<p>
If one of these machines believed it was human, or exhibited human behaviour, how would you know that it is not human-like? Is it simply because it is composed of wires?
</p>
<p>
While some would rely upon the existence of a soul, is there any proof that such a thing exists? Is it possible for a non-human to have a soul? Is it possible for a human to not have a soul?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I gave Parasite Dolls five out of five stars. The animation reminded me of Ghost in the Shell SAC, and the great music of Cowboy Bebop.
</p>
<p>
The character who really matters is the main character, who is developed rather well. Also, while the plot may have been borrowed from a number of films, Parasite Dolls has it&#39;s own unique way of telling the story, and nods kindly towards it&#39;s influences.
</p>
<p>
Due to violence, etcetera, this movie is for mature audiences.
