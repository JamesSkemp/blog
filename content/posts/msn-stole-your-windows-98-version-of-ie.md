<p>
While installing Windows 98 Second Edition on a Virtual PC 2007 virtual machine, I was running into issues with IE being hijacked by the MSN connection wizard. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, they&#39;ve also hijacked the Connect to the Internet shortcut on the Desktop. 
</p>
<p>
However, if you run <strong>icwconn1.exe</strong> from the Run menu, you should be able to connect successfully, instead of having MSN try to find a modem.
