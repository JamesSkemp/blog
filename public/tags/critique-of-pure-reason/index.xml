      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes to the Introduction of the Second Part (the Transcendental Logic) of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the months of December 2007 and January 2008, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 92 to 101 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General logic&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Our knowledge springs from two fundamental sources of the mind; the first is the capacity of receiving representations (receptivity for impressions), the second is the power of knowing an object through these representations (spontaneity [in the production] of concepts. Through the first an object is &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; to us, through the second the object is &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; in relation to that [given] representation (which is a mere determination of the mind). Intuition and concepts constitute, therefore, the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without concepts, can yield knowledge.&amp;quot; [92]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Intuitions and concepts &amp;quot;may be either pure or empirical. When they contain sensation (which presupposes the actual presence of the object), they are empirical. When there is no mingling of sensation with the representation, they are pure.&amp;quot; [92]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Our nature is so constituted that our &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; can never be other than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which enables us to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the object of sensible intuition is the understanding. [&amp;hellip;] Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. [&amp;hellip;] The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise.&amp;quot; [93]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;We therefore distinguish the science of the rules of sensibility in general, that is, aesthetic, from the science of the rules of the understanding in general, that is, logic. Logic, again, can be treated in a twofold manner, either as logic of the general or as logic of the special employment of the understanding. The former contains the absolutely necessary rules of through without which there can be no employment whatsoever of the understanding. [&amp;hellip; The latter] contains the rules of correct thinking as regards a certain kind of objects. The former may be called the logic of elements, the latter the organon of this or that science.&amp;quot; [93]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;General logic is either pure or applied. In the former we abstract from all empirical conditions under which our understanding is exercised, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; from the influence of the senses, the play of imagination, the laws of memory, the force of habit, inclination, etc., and so from all sources of prejudice, indeed from all causes from which this or that knowledge may arise or seem to arise. [&amp;hellip;] General logic is called applied, when it is directed to the rules of the employment of understanding under the subjective empirical conditions dealt with by psychology.&amp;quot; [94]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General logic &amp;quot;abstracts from all content of the knowledge of understanding and from all differences in its objects, and deals with nothing but the mere form of thought.&amp;quot; [94] It &amp;quot;abstracts from all content of knowledge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it treats of the form of thought in general.&amp;quot; [95]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pure general logic &amp;quot;has nothing to do with empirical principles, and does not [&amp;hellip;] borrow anything from psychology. [&amp;hellip;] What I call applied logic [&amp;hellip;] is a representation of the understanding and of the rules of its necessary employment &lt;em&gt;in concreto&lt;/em&gt;, that is, under the accidental subjective conditions which may hinder or help its application, and which are all given only empirically. It treats of attention, its impediments and consequences, of the source of error, of the state of doubt, hesitation, and conviction, etc.&amp;quot; [95]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transcendental logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Transcendental logic &amp;quot;concerns itself with the laws of understanding and reason solely in so far as they relate &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; to objects.&amp;quot; [97]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;The&amp;nbsp;term &amp;#39;transcendental&amp;#39; [&amp;hellip;] signifies such knowledge as concerns the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; possibility of knowledge, or its &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; employment. Neither space nor any &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; geometrical determination of it is a transcendental representation; what can be alone entitled transcendental is the knowledge that these representations are not of empirical origin, and the possibility that they can yet relate &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; to objects of experience.&amp;quot; [96]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;It would also treat of the origin of the modes in which we know objects, in so far as that origin cannot be attributed to the objects.&amp;quot; [96]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General logic as analytic or dialectic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General logic can be divided into either analytic or dialectic logic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before going into that, however, Kant first discusses &amp;#39;truth.&amp;#39; The normal definition, which is assumed, is that truth is &amp;quot;the agreement of knowledge with it object.&amp;quot; [97] However, there is another kind of truth, as regards truth in general. This truth, separate from content, is concerned more with the form&amp;nbsp;of knowledge. It is &amp;quot;the agreement of knowledge with the general and formal laws of the understanding and reason.&amp;quot; [98]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we do not abide by these rules, we are sure to not reach the truth. &amp;quot;Its rules must be applied in the examination and appraising of the form of all knowledge before we proceed to determine whether their content contains positive truth in respect to their object.&amp;quot; [98]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;But since the mere form of knowledge, however completely it may be in agreement with logical laws, is far from being sufficient to determine the material (objective) truth of knowledge, no&amp;nbsp;one can&amp;nbsp;venture with the help of logic alone to judge regarding objects, or to make any assertion.&amp;quot; [98] Earlier, &amp;quot;[i]t has no touchstone for the discovery of such error as concerns not the form but the content.&amp;quot; [98]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;We must first, independently of logic, obtain reliable information; only then are we in a&amp;nbsp;position to enquire, in accordance with logical laws, into the use of this information and its connection in a coherent whole, or rather to test it by these laws.&amp;quot; [98-99]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dialectic logic is &amp;quot;a &lt;em&gt;critique of dialectical illuision&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; which is &amp;quot;the sophistical art of giving to ignorance [&amp;hellip;] the appearance of truth, by the device of imitating the methodical thoroughness which logic prescribes, and of using its &amp;#39;topic&amp;#39; to conceal the emptiness of its pretensions.&amp;quot; [99]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transcendental logic as transcendental analytic or dialectic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;That part of transcendental logic which deals with the elements of the pure knowledge yielded by understanding, and the principles without which no object can be thought, is transcendental analytic. [&amp;hellip;] [T]his transcendental analytic should be used only as a canon for passing judgment upon the empirical employment of the understanding [&amp;hellip;]&amp;quot; [100]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is when we move beyond this, that dialectical illusion comes into play. &amp;quot;The second part of transcendental logic must therefore form a critique of this dialectical illusion, and is called transcendental dialectic [&amp;hellip;]&amp;quot; [100]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuing on &amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The remainder of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements will concern these last two; the transcendental analytic, and the transcendental dialectic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes to the General Observations on, and the Conclusion of the, Transcendental Aesthetic, of the First Part (the Transcendental Aesthetic) of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the months of December 2007 and January 2008, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 82 to 91 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;&amp;hellip; [A]ll our intution is nothing but the representation of appearance; [&amp;hellip;] the things which we intuit are not in themselves what we intuit them as being, nor their relations so constituted in themselves as they appear to us, and that if the subject, or even only the subjective constitution of the senses in general, be removed, the whole constitution and the relations of objects in space and time, nay space and time themselves, would vanish. As appearances, they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What objects may be in themselves, and apart from all this receptivity of our sensibility, remains completely unknown to us. We know nothing but our mode of perceiving them - a mode which is peculiar to us, and not necessarily shared in by every being, though, certainly, by every human being. With this alone have we any concern.&amp;quot; [82]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I look upon, or sense,&amp;nbsp;a table, I do not see the table &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, but rather an appearance of a table. This appearance is based upon my mode, or way,&amp;nbsp;of perception of objects. I can then have thoughts, internally, about this table, which&amp;nbsp;still does not give me the object &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, but rather again as an object of my experience, &amp;#39;perceived&amp;#39; by my particular way of thinking about &amp;#39;inner&amp;#39; objects. &amp;quot;This mode of intuiting in space and time need not be limited to human sensibility. It may be that all finite, thinking beings necessarily agree with man in this respect, although we are not in a position to judge whether this is actually so.&amp;quot; [90] However, Kant does not clearly justify that we can ascribe these modes of intuiting to other human beings, unless we are to assume that all appearances of beings like ourselves are human beings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To move back on track, we are unable to move beyond these appearances to the object in itself, even if our senses were to become magnified, or clarified as much as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Even if we could bring our intuition to the highest degree of clearness, we should not thereby come any nearer to the constitution of objects in themselves. We should still know only our mode of intuition, that is, our sensibility.&amp;quot; [83]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, we are not to think that objects are mere illusions. &amp;quot;For in an appearance the objects, nay even the properties that we ascribe to them, are always regarded as something actually given.&amp;quot; [88] &amp;quot;Our mode of intuition is dependent upon the existence of the object, and is therefore possible&amp;nbsp;only if the subject&amp;#39;s faculty of representation is affected by that object.&amp;quot; [90]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There must be some &amp;#39;thing&amp;#39; that is sensed by our intuition. What this is, we can judge only by how it appears to us, or how we perceive it. Unlike an illusion, however, these appearances are accessible to other beings that perceive as we do. The table is not an illusion because you too can&amp;nbsp;perceive the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having covered the transcendental aesthetic, Kant moves onto the transcendental logic, before leaving the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes on Section I and II, on Space and Time, to the First Part (the Transcendental Aesthetic) of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the month of December 2007, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 67 to&amp;nbsp;82 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the Introduction to the Transcendental Aesthetic, which makes up the first part of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, Kant told us that we&amp;#39;d be first investigating the &amp;quot;two pure forms of sensible intuition, serving as principles of &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, namely, space and time.&amp;quot; [67]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Section I: Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;By means of outer sense, a property of our mind, we represent to ourselves objects as outside of us, and all without exception in space. In space their shape, magnitude, and relation to one another are determined or determinable.&amp;quot; [67] Kant sums up his investigation of space near the end of the section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Space does not represent any property of things in themselves, nor does it represent them in their relation to one another. That is to say, space does not represent any determination that attaches to the objects themselves, and which remains even when abstraction has been made of all the subjective conditions of intuition.&amp;quot; [71]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Space is nothing but the form of all appearances of outer sense. It is the subjective condition of sensibility, under which alone outer intuition is possible for us. [&amp;hellip;] Is it, therefore, solely from the human standpoint that we can speak of space, of extended things, etc. If we depart from the subjective condition under which alone we can have outer intuition, namely, liability to be affected by objects, the representation of space stands for nothing whatsoever. This predicate can be ascribed to things only in so far as they appear to us, that is, only to objects of sensibility.&amp;quot; [71-72]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;The taste of wine does not belong to the objective&amp;nbsp;determinations of the wine, not even if by the wine as an object we mean the wine as appearance, but to the special constitution of sense in the subject that tastes it. Colours are not properties of the bodies to the intuition of which they are attached, but only modifications of the sense of sight, which is affected in a certain manner by light Space, on the other hand, as condition of outer objects, necessarily belongs to their appearance or intuition. Taste and colours are not necessary conditions under which alone objects can be for us objects on the senses. They are connected with the appearances only as effects accidentally added by the particular constituition of the sense organs. Accordingly, they are not &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; representations, but are grounded in sensation, and, indeed, in the case of taste, even upon feeling (pleasure and pain), as an effect of sensation. [&amp;hellip;] Through space alone is it possible that things should be outer objects to us.&amp;quot; [73-74]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;[S]pace is not a form inhering in things in themselves as their intrinsic property, [&amp;hellip;] objects in themselves are quite unknown to us, and [&amp;hellip;] what we call outer objects are nothing but mere representations of our sensibility, the form of which is space.&amp;quot; [73-74]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we move from these quotes to what Kant is saying, we shall move to time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Section II: Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Inner sense, by means of which the mind intuits itself or its inner state,&amp;nbsp;yields indeed no intuition of the soul itself as an object; but there is nevertheless a determinate form [namely,&amp;nbsp;time] in which alone the intuition of inner states is possible, and everything which belongs to inner determinations is therefore&amp;nbsp;represented in relations of time.&amp;quot; [67-68]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Time is not something which exists of itself, or which inheres in things as an objective determination, and it does not, therefore, remain when abstraction is made of all subjective conditions&amp;nbsp;of its intuition. [&amp;hellip;] [T]ime is nothing but the subjective condition under which alone intuition can take place in us.&amp;quot; [76]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Time is nothing but the form of inner sense, that is, of the intuition of ourselves and of our inner state.&amp;quot; [77]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Time is the formal &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; condition of all appearances whatsoever. Space, as the pure form of all &lt;em&gt;outer&lt;/em&gt; intuition, is so far limited; it serves as the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; condition only of outer appearances. But since all representations, whether they have for their objects outer things or not, belong, in themselves, as determinations of the mind, to our inner state; and since this inner state stands under the formal condition of inner intuition, and so belongs to time, time is an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; condition of all appearances whatsoever. It is the immediate condition of inner appearances (of our souls), and thereby the mediate condition of outer appearances. Just as I can say &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that all outer appearances are in space, I can also say, from the principle of inner sense, that all appearances whatsoever, that is, all objects of the senses, are in time, and necessarily stand in time-relations.&amp;quot; [77]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time &amp;quot;has objective validity only in respect of appearances, these being things which we take &lt;em&gt;as objects of our senses&lt;/em&gt;. [&amp;hellip;] Time is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition (which is always sensible, that is, so far as we are affected by objects), and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing.&amp;quot; [77-78]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;[S]ince our intuition is always sensible, no object can ever be given to us in experience which does not conform to the condition of time. [&amp;hellip;] [W]e deny that it belongs to things absolutely, as their condition or property, independently of any reference to the form of our sensible intuition.&amp;quot; [78]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Space and time, in other words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have experience of the world outside of us through sensation. Our mind processes these experiences as appearances of objects, or appearaces of the world as being a certain way. We have both an outer sense, of objects outside of us, as well as an inner sense, of states of our mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, when I taste a drink, I give it the property of tasting a certain way. I also see the drink as being in one place, for example, on the table, and then in another, such as in my hand. It is space which is the form of our outer intuitions; objects having certain properties, including shape and location. Time is a form of our inner intuitions; objects moving or changing, as well as&amp;nbsp;states succeeding other states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time is something that we add to the experience of the object; something that we use to make sense of our experiences, to aid in our understanding of those objects. As such, since they apply to the appearances of those objects, we cannot ascribe them to the objects themselves, but only to the objects as they appear to us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time is presupposed of all of our experiences. This is because for every external experience, we have an internal one as well, but not vice-versa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Space and time must be &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; in order to be general, true, rules. If, instead, they were based upon experience, they, like our experiences, would have the possibility of being wrong, or false.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just as their is one space, there is only one time. No intuition that we (as man)&amp;nbsp;have exists outside of both space and time, since all our intuitions are sensible. We can not think of an external object as existing outside of space; it must necessarily be some where. Likewise, our thoughts flow through time; it is impossible to think of a thought, or a state of our mind as not coming either before or after another thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since space and time are the form of appearances, they really exist, albeit not as objects themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Idealism&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &amp;sect;7 of this part, Kant confronts idealism, &amp;quot;which teaches that the reality of outer objects&amp;nbsp;does not allow of strict proof. On the other hand, the reality of the object of inner sense (the reality of myself and my state) is [&amp;hellip;] immediately evident through consciousness. The former may be merely an&amp;nbsp;illusion; the latter is, on their view, undeniably something real.&amp;quot; [80]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If one were to believe that Kant is denying that time, or change, is real, he replies that it is indeed real. &amp;quot;Time is [&amp;hellip;] to be regarded as real, not indeed as object but as the mode of representation of myself as object.&amp;quot; [79] It is &amp;quot;the condition of all our experiences.&amp;quot; [79]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Time and space, taken together, are the pure forms of all sensible intuition, and so are what make &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic propositions possible. But these&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a priori&lt;/em&gt; sources of knowledge, being merely conditions of our sensibility, just by this very fact determine their own limits, namely, that they apply to objects only in so far as objects are viewed as appearances, and do not present things as they are in themselves.&amp;quot; [80]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, both time and space are real, but only in so far as they are the form of all of man&amp;#39;s sensible intuition. We cannot, however, make this same claim of objects outside of their appearances (to us), since&amp;nbsp;have no experiences of these things in themselves (outside of sensation).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The following are notes on the Introduction to the First Part (the Transcendental Aesthetic) of the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the month of December 2007, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 65 to 67 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As promised in Kant&amp;#39;s Introduction, we proceed into the first division of the Critique of Pure Reason: the transcendental doctrine of elements. By the end of the Introduction, we&amp;#39;ll learn that this doctrine of elements will be further split into two parts; the first part is the &lt;em&gt;transcendental aesthetic&lt;/em&gt;, while the second part is the &lt;em&gt;transcendental logic&lt;/em&gt;. [66-67] Up until that point, Kant attempted to define the terms necessary to understand these two terms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Transcendental Aesthetic and Logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements is the transcendental aesthetic. It is &amp;quot;[t]he science of all principles of &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; sensibility.&amp;quot; [66]&amp;nbsp;This is distinct from the second part, transcendental logic, &amp;quot;which deals with the principles of pure thought.&amp;quot; [67]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To understand this, we must understand what Kant means by sensibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sensibility, in Kant&amp;#39;s words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;The capacity (receptivity) for receiving representations through the mode in which we are affected by objects, is entitled &lt;em&gt;sensibility&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; [65] Kant immediately continues. &amp;quot;Objects are &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; to us by means of sensibility, and it alone yields us &lt;em&gt;intuitions&lt;/em&gt;; they are &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; through the understanding, and from the understanding arise &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; [65] We also learn that&amp;nbsp;all thought relates to sensibility, &amp;quot;because in no other way can an object be given to us.&amp;quot; [65]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by it, is &lt;em&gt;sensation&lt;/em&gt;. That intuition which is in relation to the object through sensation, is entitled &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt;. The undetermined object of an empirical intution is entitled &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;That in the appearance which corresponds to sensation I term its &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;; but that which so determines the manifold of appearance that it allows of being ordered in certain relations, I term the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of appearance. That in which alone the sensations can be posited and ordered in a certain form, cannot itself be sensation; and therefore, while the matter of all appearance is given to us &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; only, its form must lie ready for the sensations &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; in the mind, and so must allow of being considered apart from all sensation.&amp;quot; [65-66]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sensibility, again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve successfully quoted Kant, but what does&amp;nbsp;he&amp;nbsp;really mean?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking through the text, we have the following list of terms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    objects
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    representations
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    intuitions
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    thought
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    understanding
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    concepts
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    sensation
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    appearance
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    matter
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    form
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, we have an object, such as a box. I, a man, sense the box; I see it, touch it, etcetera. I see that it is brown (color), it is fairly hard (hardness), it takes some force to put holes in it (impenetrability), etcetera. All of this is sensation. My understanding thinks of this box that it is a substance, that it can be broken up (divisibility), and etcetera. All of these are intuitions based upon the sensations; upon the experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is an appearance, of which there is a corresponding matter: the object box. However, Kant claims that there is another intuition, a &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; intuition, which determines the form of the appearance. In our object, this would be its extension and figure. There can be no appearance of an object&amp;nbsp;without either of these two &amp;#39;things.&amp;#39;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where we are going next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we continue through the transcendental aesthetic, this will hopefully become clearer. We learn that we shall take sensibility, removing from it until we have &amp;quot;empirical intuition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pure intuition and the mere form of appearances.&amp;quot; [67]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will also learn more about the &amp;quot;two pure forms of sensible intuition, serving as principles of &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, namely, space and time.&amp;quot; [67]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A note on the word &amp;#39;aesthetic&amp;#39;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The word &amp;#39;aesthetic&amp;#39; is often used,&amp;nbsp;today, in classes of the arts. In these areas, aesthetics is &amp;quot;the critique of taste.&amp;quot;[66]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant, however, calls the attempt to &amp;quot;bring the critical treatment of the beautiful under rational principles, and so to raise its rules of the&amp;nbsp;rank of science,&amp;quot; fruitless.&amp;nbsp;[66] This is because he sees it&amp;nbsp;related so closely to man&amp;#39;s experiences, and cannot be&amp;nbsp;attributed to &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; laws.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore, when Kant uses the word &amp;#39;aesthetic&amp;#39; he means the doctrine of sensibility, and not the critique of taste.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/posts/Notes-on-Immanuel-Kants-Critique-of-Pure-Reason-Introduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2007 23:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/posts/Notes-on-Immanuel-Kants-Critique-of-Pure-Reason-Introduction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes on the&amp;nbsp;Introduction&amp;nbsp;of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the month of December 2007, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages&amp;nbsp;41 to&amp;nbsp;62 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having now covered the two Prefaces, we find ourself at Kant&amp;#39;s Introduction to the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. Since we are now within the actual work, it is not so easy to single out just the first (A) from the second (B) edition. Therefore, all future notes will cover both, dispersing them as necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, Kant&amp;#39;s Introduction was impacted by a number of removals and additions, in an attempt to clarify and simplify the text. When something that was in the first edition, was removed in the second, but which I believe still helps clarify a point, I am not against adding it back in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, there are a few terms which it would be helpful to explain right away, since Kant disperses them throughout his Introduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have first &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge is &amp;quot;knowledge absolutely independent of all experience.&amp;quot; [43] He will also call this knowledge &amp;#39;pure&amp;#39; knowledge if it has no &amp;#39;basis&amp;#39; on experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A posteriori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge is &amp;quot;empirical knowledge,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;through experience.&amp;quot; [43]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge allows us to say that it is both necessary and universal. This is contrary to &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; (empirical) knowledge, since experience can only teach us from what we have seen. &amp;quot;Experience tells us [&amp;hellip;] what is, but not that it must necessarily be so, and not otherwise.&amp;quot; [42]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analytic and synthetic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, we have analytic and synthetic judgments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we have the general statement &amp;#39;A is B,&amp;#39; we have a subject or concept, A, and a predicate, B.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In analytic judgments, &amp;quot;the predicate B belongs to the subject A, as something which is (covertly) contained in this concept A.&amp;quot; [48]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In synthetic judgments, the predicate &amp;quot;B lies outside the concept A, although it does indeed stand in connection with it.&amp;quot; [48]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An analytic judgment is one like &amp;quot;&amp;#39;All bodies are extended&amp;#39;,&amp;quot; while a synthetic is one like &amp;#39;All bodies are heavy&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; [48-49] In other words, when we think of a body we necessarily include extension. The connection of weight and body, however, is gained from experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this latter idea is somewhat confusing, it may be helpful of thinking about removing the predicate from the subject, or replacing it with the negation. For example, we can think of a body without weight, floating in our mind. However, we can not think of a body without extension or dimensions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we&amp;#39;ve seen, analytic judgments break the subject into parts, or the concepts, that make up the subject. Synthetic judgments add to the subject, by way of experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Later, Kant gives us two examples, from the realm of logic, of analytic propositions. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;; the whole is equal to itself&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, that is, the whole is greater than its part.&amp;quot; [54]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also find that synthetic judgments do not necessarily have to come from experience, and can be &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;A priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant states that &amp;quot;the proper problem of pure reason is contained in the question: How are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments possible?&amp;quot; [55] Later, &amp;quot;the mere analysis of the concepts that inhere in our reason &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, is by no means the aim of, but only preparation for, metaphysics proper, that is, the extension of its &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic knowledge.&amp;quot; [57]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, what are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He first provides us with the proposition &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Everything which happens has its cause.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; [50] Since &amp;quot;the concept of a &amp;#39;cause&amp;#39; lies entirely outside the other concept, and signifies something different from &amp;#39;that which happens,&amp;#39; we do indeed have a synthetic judgment. However, this cannot be &lt;em&gt;a posteriori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, since it claims &amp;#39;universality&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;necessity,&amp;#39; &amp;quot;on the basis of mere concepts.&amp;quot; [51]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In short, we make an &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgment&amp;#39; when we state that everything is caused.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;[T]hat in all changes of the material world the quantity of matter remains unchanged; and that in all communication of motion, action and reaction must always be equal&amp;quot; are two principles of physics which are also &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments. [54] In addition, &amp;quot;metaphysics consists, at least &lt;em&gt;in intention&lt;/em&gt;, entirely of &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic propositions.&amp;quot; [55]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We might say, then, that &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments are those necessary and universal judgments that prescribe some predicate to some object, independent of experience, which is not already contained within the identity of the object. For instance, all actions are caused.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we now have an idea of what &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments are, we are also back to the question of how &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments are possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transcendental philosophy and the critique of pure reason&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, little progress has been made in answering this question, the question of how &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments are possible. Yet, despite that, &amp;quot;in all men, as soon as their reason has become ripe for speculation, there has always existed and will always continue to exist some kind of metaphysics.&amp;quot; [56]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Contradictions arise from man&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;mere disposition to metaphysics,&amp;quot; which raise the question of whether a science of metaphysics is possible. [57] If we were to perform a critique of this possibility, we would therefore be performing a critique of pure reason (pure reason, as we saw earlier, concerns the question of how &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; synthetic judgments are possible). We would not be building a system of pure reason, but rather merely examining it, seeking &amp;quot;not to extend, but only to clarify our reason, and keep it free from errors.&amp;quot; [59]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant also calls this a &amp;#39;transcendental critique.&amp;#39; It is to &amp;quot;supply a touchstone of the value, or lack of value, of all &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.&amp;quot; It is to serve as a preparation by which &amp;quot;the complete system of the philosophy of pure reason [&amp;hellip;] may be carried into execution.&amp;quot; [59]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, the transcendental critique, or critique of pure reason, is not equivalent to transcendental philosophy, for this would &amp;quot;have to contain an exhaustive analysis of the whole of /a priori/ human knowledge,&amp;quot; while the critique concerns itself with the framework or foundation for this analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elements and methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we are pursuing a science, it is customary, and indeed wise, to make divisions as necessary. The two chief divisions are a doctrine of the elements of pure reason, and the method of pure reason. Reviewing the table of contents, we see that this is indeed how the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; proceeds, with subdivisions beneath each.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/posts/Notes-on-Immanuel-Kants-Critique-of-Pure-Reason-Preface-to-Second-Edition/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2007 18:45:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/posts/Notes-on-Immanuel-Kants-Critique-of-Pure-Reason-Preface-to-Second-Edition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes on the Preface of the second edition of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the month of December 2007, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 17 to 37 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s quite a difference from the first edition&amp;#39;s Preface to the second&amp;#39;s. First, we have the size difference, from nine pages to 21. We also have Kant at his wordiest, giving us a taste of what Kemp Smith calls &amp;quot;his manner of writing.&amp;quot; [xxiv] Speaking of Kant, Kemp Smith sums this up rather well. &amp;quot;He crowds so much into each sentence, that he is constrained to make undue use of parentheses.&amp;quot; [xxiv]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In fact, the second sentence of the second edition&amp;#39;s Preface is such an example. In the first edition&amp;#39;s Preface, we learned that Kant is attempting, in this &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;, to understand pure reason. In this rather long second sentence, Kant reminds us how a science, which is what he is trying to attain for reason, differs from mere &amp;#39;random groping.&amp;#39;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deconstructing that sentence, if we can say of the outcome that;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    after elaborate preparations, frequently renewed, it is brought to a stop immediatley it nears its goal,
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    often it is compelled to retrace its steps and strike into some new line of approach,
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    the various participants are unable to agree in any common plan of procedure,
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;hellip; &amp;quot;then we may rest assured that it is very far from having entered upon the secure path of a science, and is indeed a merely random groping.&amp;quot; [17] If, however, we were able to find a path by which to understand reason, and escape all of the above situtations, then we shall have found a truely scientific path, and will be able to abandon any beliefs that do not fall on that path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Logic, says Kant, is an example of such a system, which, other than minor changes, has stayed consistent since the time of Aristotle. Nor can the system be advanced, outside of what Kant believes are misconceptions. If such a system could be obtain for pure reason, we would reach our goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant further elaborates on logic, stating that the scope of logic is limited to giving &amp;quot;an exhaustive exposition and a strict proof of the formal rules of all thought.&amp;quot; [18] Logic, too, doesn&amp;#39;t deal with individual objects, but rather abstracts from them, whatever those objects may be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We later have a discussion of mathematics, followed by that of the natural sciences. To learn from nature, we read, reason has principles and experiments which have been devised. Those experiments must be questions of nature, which elict an answer; we cannot merely watch and listen to nature to discover its secrets. [20]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Metaphysics, which was also discussed in the first edition&amp;#39;s Preface, is without such a system. &amp;quot;[M]etaphysics has rather to be regarded as a battle-ground quite peculiarly suited for those who desire to exercise themselves in mock combats, and in which no participant has ever yet succeeded in gaining even so much s an inch of territory, not at least in such manner as to secure him in its permanent possession.&amp;quot; [21] What makes this even more difficult is that metaphysics &amp;quot;soars far above the teachings of experience&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rests on concepts alone.&amp;quot; [21]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since metaphysics is older than all the other sciences, and it has not yet found the path, perhaps it is impossible to find one? Or, perhaps we&amp;#39;ve been going about it the wrong way. Kant believes the latter. Like Copernicus, who switched the spectator with the heavenly bodies, Kant would have us switch for metaphysics as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Hitherto it has been assumed that all our knowledge must conform to objects. [&amp;hellip;] We must therefore make trial whether we may not have more success in the tasks of metaphysics, if we suppose that objects must conform to our knowledge. [&amp;hellip;] A similar experiment can be tried in metaphysics, as regards the &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; of objects. If intuition must conform to the constitution of the objects, I do not see how we could know anything of the latter &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;; but if the object (as object of the senses) must conform to the constitution of our faculty of intuition, I have no difficulty in conceiving such a possibility.&amp;quot; [22]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By doing this for other things, we escape from &amp;quot;the conclusion that we can never transcend the limits of possible experience,&amp;quot; and so are able to work towards achieving what metaphysics would have us achieve. [24]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have, then, what Kant is attempting to do in this &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;This attempt to alter the procedure which has hitherto prevailed in metaphysics, by completely revolutionising it in accordance with the example set by the geometers and physicists, forms indeed the main purpose of this critique of pure speculative reason. It is a treatise on the method, not a system of the science itself. But at the same time it marks out the whole plan of the science, both as regards its limits and as regards its entire internal structure.&amp;quot; [25]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;On a cursory view of the present work it may seem that its results are merely &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt;, warning us that we must never venture with speculative reason beyond the limits of experience. [&amp;hellip;] But such teaching at once acquires a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; value when we recognise that the principles with which speculative reason ventures out beyond its proper limits do not in effect &lt;em&gt;extend&lt;/em&gt; the employment of reason, but, as we find on closer scrutiny, inevitably &lt;em&gt;narrow&lt;/em&gt; it.&amp;quot; [26] By venturing outside, we may bring about conflict within reason itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings about a distinction between &amp;quot;things as objects of experience and those same things as things in themselves.&amp;quot; To provide an example, Kant uses the question of the freedom of the soul. [27-29]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After this discussion we get to what really should be of concern, which is what we may hope to gain by finding a system of science for reason.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;[N]ot only will reason be enabled to follow the secure path of a science, instead of, as hitherto, groping at random, without circumspection or self-criticism; our enquiring youth will also be in a position to spent their time more profitably than in the ordinary dogmatism by which they are so early and greatly encouraged to indulge in easy speculation about things of which they understand nothing, and into which neither they nor anyone else will ever have any insight - encouraged, indeed, to invent new ideas and opinions, while neglecting the study of the better-established sciences.&amp;quot; [30]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By cutting out the &amp;#39;injurious&amp;#39; influences, we are able to silence all objections by &amp;quot;the clearest proof&amp;quot; obtained by &amp;quot;sufficient groups of proof.&amp;quot; [30, 31] Empty speculation will be replaced by true knowledge, which will end the needless battle of the &amp;#39;ignorant objectors.&amp;#39;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Criticism alone can sever the root of &lt;em&gt;materialism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatalism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;atheism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;free-thinking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fanaticism&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;superstition&lt;/em&gt; [&amp;hellip;]; as well as of &lt;em&gt;idealism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;scepticism&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; [32]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As regards the remainder the Preface, it deals with changes from the first to the second editions, which need not be covered here.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are notes on the Preface of the first edition of Immanuel Kant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. For the month of December 2007, I&amp;#39;ll be reading the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; and writing notes as I go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 7 to 15 of this edition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to Kant, human beings find themselves asking questions which can be neither ignored, nor answered. Using reason and experience, man deals with aspect after aspect of these questions, finally resorting to principles outside of empirical experience, eventually leading to contradictions and controversy. These questions are in the realm of metaphysics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While metaphysics was once honored, Kant believes it is now not even common, but rather scorned. While the dogmatists controlled metaphysics, it relied on despotism;&amp;nbsp;the truth was hidden, known to only a select view which had received the right knowledge, or &amp;#39;vision.&amp;#39; Traces of barbarism remained, however,&amp;nbsp;leading to chaos and the sceptics, where we question whether we can really know what is beyond experience, or even if we can know what we experience. New systems came around, however, such as Locke&amp;#39;s, but despite it all, indifferentism seemed to take hold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, those who claim indifference are anything but, since our reason finds itself drawn back to these questions. Instead, indifferentism has done something to remove the majority of traces of metaphysics&amp;#39; troubled history.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The matured judgment of the age of which Kant is part has, because of its refusal to rely on illusory knowledge, has undertaken the task of self-knowledge, and to &amp;quot;institute a tribunal which will assure to reason its lawful claims, and dismiss all groundless pretensions, not by despotic decrees, but in accordance with its own eternal and unalterable laws.&amp;quot; [9] This is an &amp;quot;age of criticism.&amp;quot; [9]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a critique of pure reason, a critique of &amp;quot;the faculty of reason in general, in respect of all knowledge after which it may strive &lt;em&gt;independently of all experience&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; [9]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant believes he has found a way to prevent &amp;quot;those errors which have hitherto set reason, in its non-empirical employment, at variance with itself.&amp;quot; [9-10] He did not need to rely on dogma to get to this method, which are &amp;quot;not within the intention of the natural constitution of our reason.&amp;quot; [10]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead, he has used &amp;quot;nothing save reason itself and its pure thinking,&amp;quot; which he found within himself. [10] After all, the question he&amp;#39;s seeking to answer is &amp;quot;how much we can hope to achieve by reason, when all the material and assistance of experience are taken away.&amp;quot; [10-11] Put another way, &amp;quot;what and how much can the understanding and reason know apart from all experience?&amp;quot; [12]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As is necessary for certainty, &amp;quot;it is in no wise permissible to hold opinions&amp;quot; during this enquiry. [11] Kant will also employ concepts for discursive (logical) clearness, but may not be able to provide examples and illustrations. This is due primarily to the amount it would add to the work, which, he feels, would actually make the work less clear as it would detract from the grasp of the whole. &amp;quot;For the aids to clearness, through they may be of assistance in regard to details, often interfere with our grasp of the whole.&amp;quot; [13]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant understands that this will make the book less accessible for &amp;quot;popular consumption,&amp;quot; but should not deter &amp;quot;genuine students of the science&amp;quot; (of metaphysics). [13]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
