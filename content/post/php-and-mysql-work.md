<p>
I&#39;m looking for ideas on what I can write in PHP and MySQL.&nbsp; Thus far, I&#39;ve written:
</p>
<p>
<!--adsense-->1) A comments system, that still gets hit by spam (but don&#39;t they all?).
</p>
<p>
2) An admin interface to upload documents, then create a record in a database for display elsewhere (along with categories and related articles/documents).
</p>
<p>
I just don&#39;t know - what do I *need* for functionality?&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll look further into creating a RSS reader - I just don&#39;t know ...
</p>
