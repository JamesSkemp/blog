<p>
My hypothesis is that you can in fact judge a philosophy book by it&#39;s cover. Which is to say;<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
A philosophy book with a simple exterior, is typically more dense internally. Id est, it takes a little more thought to get through.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a philosophy book that has a more colourful, or designed, exterior, is typically for a larger audience.
</p>
<p>
What comes to mind for proof is the Cambridge and Oxford books I have of the writings of Schopenhauer, versus some of the I Ching or introductory philosophy books I own.
</p>
<p>
For the most part, I think this stands fairly true.
</p>
<p>
Thoughts on this conclusion?
