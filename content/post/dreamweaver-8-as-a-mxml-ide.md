<p>
I&#39;ve spent the last couple of hours trying to get Dreamweaver 8 to begin to function as a MXML IDE. Unfortunately, while I can get every &lt;mx: tag added to the code hints, I&#39;m having a heck of a time getting the actual code hints to function.

<p>
The small tutorial that Macromedia (and truly it was Macromedia at the time) provided isn&#39;t very helpful at all. CodeSnipers.com (link below) has some information on using Dreamweaver 8 a Ruby IDE, but since Ruby appears to be so function based ...
</p>
<p>
My open call is this; can anyone point me to a good tutorial that focuses on setting up CodeHints.xml, TagChooser.xml, and TagLibraries.vtm? Or, just CodeHints.xml?
