	<p>
	the terrible thing about hell<br />
	is that when you&#39;re there you can&#39;t even tell<br />
	as you move through this life you love so<br />
	you could be there and not even know
	</p>
	<p>
	but you say so what I&#39;m doing just fine<br />
	the irony is that it&#39;s all in your mind<br />
	and that&#39;s why hell is so vicious and cruel<br />
	but you&#39;ll just go on an oblivious fool

When you really think about it, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that life is striving, with small parts of boredom thrown in. This is obvious, I think, because everything we do is towards some goal, or end. Yet, once the goal is met, we find another goal to work towards.
</p>
<p>
Yet, they say that Heaven is not like this; that instead, we have everything we need and want. This suggests that we must either be bored, continually striving towards new goals, which are immediately attained, and/or in some other state that we can&#39;t even know, being a part of the world we live in (which is, &#39;through-and-through will,&#39; striving).
</p>
<p>
To some extent, the fact that we can never attain a goal that does not open us up to seeking, or finding without seeking, another, suggests that we may perhaps be in a sort of hell, not unlike what Phish suggests in &quot;Shafty.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Yet, by the same token, we may already be in paradise. True, we&nbsp;have before us an unlimited&nbsp;number of goals to strive towards, from birth to death; every moment of our life is striving, or the briefest of moments between those periods (save for those very few who have attained a life without striving).
</p>
<p>
Along these lines I can recall a story I read many years ago (it may have been in <em>Dangerous Visions</em> ...). In that story the main character commits suicide, thinking that there&#39;s a better life (or something to that effect). Instead, after death, he finds that this was in fact a paradise, or rather, a vacation from his time elsewhere, which was in fact a kind of hell, in that it demanded so much of him.

Billy Joel once sang that he&#39;d &#39;rather laugh with the sinners, than cry with the saints.&#39;
</p>
<p>
Too we must remember the Twilight Zone episode in which a man can never lose at pool. Yet, while that would make most happy for a while, the inability to lose would itself drive one crazy. No competition means the victory is flat.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, I would almost rather hope that Leibniz is correct, that this is the &#39;best of all possible worlds,&#39; and further, that we can live (in any sense of the world) in just this one.
