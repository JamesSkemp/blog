<p>
There are a number of movies out there that seem like they go on far longer than one would have thought.  Two hours long, but it feels like it&#39;s over four.  Ran is one of these movies, but in the best possible light.<!--more-->

<blockquote>
	Legendary Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa retells Shakespeare&#39;s classic tragedy King Lear against a samurai backdrop. Tatsuya Nakadia is a warlord who transfers his kingdom to his eldest son. A power struggle ensues, incited by his two disinherited younger sons. Kurosawa is a master storyteller (almost on par with The Bard himself), and Ran ranks among the maestro&#39;s most compelling films.

Akira Kurosawa is the same Akira Kurosawa of <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/10/03/240/movie-review-seven-samurai-criterion-collection-1954/">Seven Samurai</a>, which I&#39;ve already reviewed, and which I also enjoyed.  While I actually picked up a copy of Ran from a local ShopKo, I had initially put it into <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/09/26/237/netflix-shipping-for-madison-wi/">my Netflix queue</a>, especially after having seen Seven Samurai.

While similar to Seven Samurai in many ways, Ran is actually, as the description above stated, based on Shakespeare&#39;s King Lear.  A part of me, and no small part at that, now has a deep interest in pulling his Complete Works off of my shelf so that I can read this story.  In the meantime, I&#39;ve made a note to put as many of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s movies in my queue as I can.

<p>
I&#39;ve given Ran a five stars rating, and have, as I said above, picked up a copy of the movie.  While points may seem to drag on, and it seems like it&#39;s over three hours long, it&#39;s a pretty darn good movie.  Unfortunately, not everyone will like this film, but it&#39;s nonetheless worth watching at least once, especially if you like Akira Kurosawa&#39;s other works, are interested in feudal Japan, or even Shakespeare and/or King Lear.
