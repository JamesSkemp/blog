      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m at work, just finishing up my lunch period, and I&amp;#39;m really wishing I had access to my Ubuntu machine right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason? I just put in a CD of 200 images - one of my backup CDs - and was hoping to get a quick glance at what images were contained on the CD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, Windows was crawling through the thumbnail generation. Adobe Bridge isn&amp;#39;t much faster (but is what I ended up going with).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grr ... 
&lt;/p&gt;
