<p>
Since I now have actual content, there can be more visitors to <a href="http://logparserplus.com/" target="_blank">Log Parser Plus</a>, outside of the government.
</p>
<p>
In additon to posting the articles here, I&#39;ll be posting a number of articles to <a href="http://logparserplus.com/" target="_blank">Log Parser Plus</a> in an attempt to make Microsoft&#39;s Log Parser utility that much easier.
</p>
<p>
The initial focus will be on IIS-related queries, but who knows where it&#39;ll end up.
