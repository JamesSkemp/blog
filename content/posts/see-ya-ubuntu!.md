<p>
Ubuntu 7.04 - see ya later.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s right, I&#39;m going to blow my Dell machine away (old work computer - I don&#39;t buy Dell machines any more).
</p>
<p>
Fear not, I&#39;ll be installing 7.04 Server Edition ...
</p>
<p>
I just hope I backed up everything ... it&#39;s good I documented (on this very site) what I did ... :D
