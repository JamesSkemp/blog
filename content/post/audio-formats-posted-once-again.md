<p>
A while back, I ended up recording a number of my pieces using the free Audacity software. However, the files soon disappeared from the Web.

These have been added to the respective posts, and are once again available for download. 
</p>
<p>
Use the <strong>listen</strong> tag to find the articles. At this time, it looks like there are just three, but more <em>will</em> be added.
