An old and popular saying states that &lsquo;<em>God</em> is odd&rsquo;. But is there any validity to this claim? This article shows that there is indeed validity and truth to this claim. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>God</em> consists, or is equal to the addition, of three characters; &lsquo;G&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, and &lsquo;d&rsquo;.</li>
	<li>If a number is not evenly divisible by two, that number is odd.</li>
	<li>Three divided by two is one-and-one-half, therefore three is not evenly divisible by two.</li>
	<li>Since three is not evenly divisible by two, three is odd.</li>
	<li>Since &lsquo;God&rsquo; is three characters, &lsquo;God&rsquo; is odd.</li>
	<li>Since <em>God</em> is &lsquo;God&rsquo;, and since &lsquo;God&rsquo; is odd, <em>God</em> is odd.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some people are likely to contest the sixth point. According to the rules of logic, if something, <em>x</em>, is equal to another thing, <em>y</em>, and that other thing, <em>y</em>, is equal to something else, <em>z</em>, the first thing is equal to the third thing. Put in logical terms, 
</p>
<p>
((x &equiv; y) &amp; (y &equiv; z)) &sup; (x &equiv; z) 
</p>
<p>
In our case, x is equal to <em>God</em>, y is equal to &lsquo;God&rsquo;, and z is equal to &lsquo;is odd&rsquo;. Seeing this, we cannot contest that the conclusion is logically sound. Since the conclusion necessarily follows from the previous numbers, it must be that <em>God</em> is odd, and that this saying is indeed true.
