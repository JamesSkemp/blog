The following is a review of [FELINE GREENIES Dental Treats Oven Roasted Chicken Flavor 11 Ounces][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Mostly Cat Approved

Years ago, we started giving Greenies to our cat after the vet had recommended them to help clean our cat's teeth. Since then I've picked up Greenies on an occasional base for my last cat, but never for the three cats I'm living with now.

One thing that worried me about the 11 oz. container was the lid. We previously had purchased another brand of cat treats and the corner of the lid eventually broke off from being opened and closed repeatedly, as well as after our youngest bit away at it (but mostly from the opening/closing).

We haven't run into the issue yet with this container, but I'll be keeping my eye on how well this lid handles the pressures of being opened and closed multiple times.

As for how our cats like them, surprisingly, the youngest doesn't care for these at all, while the other two enjoy them well enough, with the middle one, who's usually quite picky, quite liking them. We mostly use these as treats, even though one of our cats has quite the build-up, so no noticeable results yet. I also can't speak to the taste.

I've always seen Greenies as a more premium product, compared to other alternatives. However, the [Iams oral care treats][iams] that we usually get, while enjoyed by all three cats, doesn't seem to be making much of a dent on build-up on our middle cat's teeth.

For these reasons, I tentatively give the [11 oz Feline Greenies][review] four of five stars. If the lid starts suffering from wear and tear, the review will be updated accordingly, as well as once we see more with one of our cat's teeth.
