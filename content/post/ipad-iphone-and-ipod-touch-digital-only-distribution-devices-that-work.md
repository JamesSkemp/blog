<p>Former colleague Rob Lumley posted an article a few months ago about <a rel="external" href="http://rmlumley.com/2010/08/finding-good-movies-on-netflix-instant-viewing/">Netflix instant viewing</a>.</p>
<p>While responding to another comment I had an epiphany. The PSPgo was Sony's attempt to go all digital for game distribution. And it wasn't much of a success, especially since not all games are available (even recent titles, like the 'new' Kingdom Hearts).</p>
<p>However, the iPhone, iPod Touch, and now iPad use completely digital distribution for their games, and they're doing absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Is it perhaps the audience of the devices that causes this difference?&nbsp;Do 'gamers' prefer physical media, while the general public, now used to electronic distribution for their music, is more open to electronic distribution, not having grown up with the enjoyment of cracking open a game, reading the manual, and popping the disc into the console?</p>
<p>Has the media talked about this, or have they completely overlooked this?</p>
