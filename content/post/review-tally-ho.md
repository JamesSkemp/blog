The following is a review of Tally Ho!, provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Surprisingly enjoyable and fair

When I was initially reading the rules of [Tally Ho!][product] I was admittedly wondering how fair and fun the game was going to be. However, having now played the game I can honestly say it was both enjoyable and fair.

Tally Ho! plays out on a large board, with all but one space filled by a double-sided tile. Over the course of the game tiles are flipped over, with some being able to be moved by the players, while others cannot.

Over the course of a 'round' each player will control their tiles to capture the other player's tiles, or the neutral ones. Points are then totaled and the player's roles change, for fairness.

Tally Ho! has an aesthetic that makes it look like it's geared for kids, but having played with adults it can be enjoyed by them too, especially given just how strategic the game can be, with pieces having different movements and capture abilities, and random, since pieces are unknown until they're flipped.

Despite being something of a hardcore gamer, I actually found this game to be fun, and something I'd play again. Being a two-player only game does limit how much I'd play it, but it could be a good game to play with someone who doesn't play too many games.

For what it is, I'd give [Tally Ho!][product] five of five stars.
