The following is a review of [Contigo's 24 oz AUTOSEAL Chill Stainless Steel Water Bottle][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Another High Quality Contigo Product
About 3 years ago I invested pretty heavily in [Aladdin][aladdin] brand water bottles, after a co-worker turned me on to them. Unfortunately, after time I found that the tops were pretty easy to break, and the bottle easily dented from relatively minor falls.

A year ago another coworker told me about Contigo, and I picked up a [Contigo AUTOSEAL West Loop Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug with Easy Clean Lid][contigo-travel], which I liked so much I purchased one for another coworker. My girlfriend too used a [Contigo Auto Seal Cortland Water Bottle][contigo-water], and earlier this year I purchased four more bottles, of varying colors, for the two of us to use.

I enjoy ice cold water, so I don't use the Cortland bottles except for late night water at home, since ice in the bottles quickly leads to moisture forming on the outside of the bottles, and the ice melting rather quickly.

[Contigo's 24 oz AUTOSEAL Chill Stainless Steel Water Bottle][review], being made of stainless steel, does not suffer this same fate. While ice doesn't seem to last as long as the Aladdin bottles, or maybe even the Contigo West Loop bottles, no moisture is formed on the outside of the bottle.

Like Cortland bottles there's a loop that can be used to hold or for tying to something. However, the piece is solid, so it can't be clipped on by itself.

Like many of Contigo's products, this bottle features an AUTOSEAL button, which must be pushed to drink water. I found the amount of pressure needed comparable to the Cortland bottles, and less than the travel mugs.

On the other hand, the size of the hole is comparable to the travel mugs (wider), which is more than the Cortland bottles (which are circular). I actually prefer the wider holes as it provides more water at once.

The lid also features a plastic X on the underside, which seems to prevent chunks of ice from getting 'stuck' in the lid. This does have a slight impact on cleaning however, but like other Contigo bottles cleaning is still fairly easy.

The only downside I have is that the product is taller than the [West Loop travel mugs][contigo-travel] and [Cortland water bottles][contigo-water], which has lead to a bit of trouble when trying to flip up on ice at work, but no issue with filling up from different freestanding water dispensers.

As evident above, I've become a fan of Contigo, and the [24 oz AUTOSEAL Chill Stainless Steel Water Bottle][review] is yet another quality product from them. I would recommend this product just as I would their others, and give it a full five of five stars.
