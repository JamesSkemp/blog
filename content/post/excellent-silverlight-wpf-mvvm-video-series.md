<p>Here's an excellent video series on Silverlight/WPF (XAML basically) and the MVVM pattern.</p>
<p>He does, what I believe to be, an excellent job of covering XAML and MVVM during this series, and includes a bit of unit testing as well.</p>
<p>Part one is included below, but another user on YouTube created a <a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A7B55DEDF2293DEC&amp;playnext=1&amp;v=g53__vPihFY">Playlist</a> with the eight videos released.</p>
<p>Update: Or you can view his blog post, <a href="http://www.timecockpit.com/en/blogs/10-09-10/time_cockpit_at_NRWConf.aspx" rel="external">time cockpit at NRWConf</a>.</p>
