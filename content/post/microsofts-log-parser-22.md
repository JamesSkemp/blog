<p>
Year&#39;s ago, Microsoft released Log Parser 2.2, which is a tool for analyzing IIS log files, event viewer exports, and etcetera.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/profwin/pw0505.mspx" target="_blank">Professor Windows article from May 2005</a> which covers Log Parser, to some extent, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/tools/logparser/default.mspx" target="_blank">download is available from Microsoft</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it&#39;s all command line, but it seems interesting enough, nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
I would have liked to have used AWStats (and probably still will), but I just didn&#39;t want to bother with the config file today.
</p>
<h3>Update, 9/13/2007</h3>
<p>
I&#39;m really glad I found Log Parser, instead of simply using AWStats. For an IIS server, Log Parser is heaven sent.&nbsp;
