<p>
Recently, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about where I&#39;d like to be when I get older. 
</p>
<p>
For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve been thinking ahead - it&#39;s just the way I am. The time frame has spanned from a mere hours from the present, to a number of years. Thirty (30), though, is a pretty special kind of birthday. The fact that it&#39;s about 3 years and 3 months away for me, makes it even particularly more so. 
</p>
<p>
Between now and my 27th birthday, which obviously takes place in May (obvious because if you&#39;ve been paying attention you know it&#39;s three months from February), I hope to solidify some of the larger plans I&#39;d like to be working through, or positions that I&#39;d like to be in. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a quick list now, that I&#39;ll undoubtedly add to, but is a start nonetheless. These are also things that I think I&#39;ll be able to obtain, even if I made no changes from my current behaviours. Those requiring changes will go on the fuller list.
