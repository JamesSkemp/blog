The best thing about Karate is that you can be walking down the street with someone and they can bust a Karate Move&trade; just like that. 
</p>
<p>
Karate, pronounced care-aht-tay, is more than just a way of life; it&rsquo;s also a way of being and living. On a scale from one to ten, it&rsquo;s ten times God. 
</p>
<p>
One time I was walking down the street with my friend and he was like &lsquo;Woah! Karate Move&trade;!&rsquo; and I turned and saw it and was totally stunned. 
</p>
<p>
My friend Mark, who&rsquo;s from Canada, lives the Karate way, but he pronounces, and spells, it differently. He says Karate should be spelt like &lsquo;Karata&rsquo; and should be pronounced like &lsquo;Care-aht-tah&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Care-aht-tay&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s a funny guy. 
</p>
<p>
Mark told me that his uncle could do this really amazing Karate Move&trade; that was cool beyond words, but that he died before Mark could learn it. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes when I&rsquo;m eating at his house I have to chuckle quietly to myself since I sorta believe that he&rsquo;s making it up. But, just because someone acts funny doesn&rsquo;t mean that they really are like that. My friend Joe&rsquo;s dad acts real weird, but he&rsquo;s pretty cool and let&rsquo;s us borrow video equipment and stuff. 
</p>
<p>
One time me and Joe tried to get Mark to do a Karate Move&trade; for us on video, but the only time he did a Karate Move&trade; was right before we left. I don&rsquo;t blame Mark, but I think it would be something to get a Karate Move&trade; on video. 
</p>
<p>
Chuck, another friend of mine that lives the Karate way, says that you just can&rsquo;t get a Karate Move&trade; on video because it&rsquo;s never been done. 
</p>
<p>
I guess that&rsquo;s why me and Joe were unable to get Mark on video except for when he was standing around and not busting a Karate Move&trade;. 
</p>
<p>
In short, Karate is not just a way of moving, it&rsquo;s also a way of life. Karate is so cool because you never know when someone is going to bust a Karate Move&trade;.
