<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RTM1O?tag=strivinglifen-20">Philips DLP2277 Attachable Battery Pack and Charging Base for iPhone and iPod</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When I ordered this item I was expecting only what the box suggested; a battery pack that could be connected to the iPod, which would charge the phone, and in turn be charged by the base station.</p>
<p>Instead what I got was a box full of goodies.</p>
<p>First you have the battery itself, which while of a fairly large size, seems to fit perfectly with the odd case I have for my iPod Touch. The connection from the battery to the iPod has some amount of flexibility, which is rather nice.</p>
<p>This battery can then be charged either by setting it on top of the charging station, or you can plug a USB (mini B, I believe) into it directly and charge that way.</p>
<p>The base station is of a nice enough design that I had no difficulty setting the battery on it.</p>
<p>It too has a USB cable for power.</p>
<p>Additionally the package comes with a power outlet to USB device, which means that I can also use my standard iPod cable to charge just the iPod. Since I was thinking I'd have to purchase one of these anyways, this makes for an extremely great package.</p>
<p>The only downside with this product is that the connection into the iPod is large enough that I can't plug into the headphone jack when the battery is connected. This is unfortunate, but can be worked around, and isn't a big enough issue that I'd downgrade my rating of 5 stars.</p>
<p>In short, an amazing number of components with the package, allowing for a number of charging possibilities.</p>
