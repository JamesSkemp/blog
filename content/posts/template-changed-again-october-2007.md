<p>
Once again, I&#39;ve changed the template for the site. This time I&#39;m using <strong>Royal Flowers</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The name comes from the purple flowers (taken outside of Madison Wisconsin&#39;s capitol building (see the <a href="/gallery/">Galleries</a> for more shots) and that purple usually signifies royalty, or richness.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure that the left-side navigation has been done the best it could be, but ... overall I&#39;m pretty happy with it.
