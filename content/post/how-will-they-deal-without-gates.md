<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71167-0.html">Wired News</a> reports that Bill Gates has that he will &quot;transition out of a day-to-day role at the company he co-founded to spend more time on global health and education work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&quot;.  The question after reading this is, what will they do?<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
What will Microsoft do?  Hardly the question I&#39;m asking.  Rather, what will those that hate Bill do?  Will they continue to blindly attack Microsoft products; after all, Bill will still be on the board.  Or, will they start realizing that MS can perhaps be a force?
</p>
<p>
Of course, MS needs to stop copying (said here and now, lest people assume I&#39;m absolutely pro-MS; how long has IE development halted before they realized that they were losing marketshare, and how often do they grab someone&#39;s idea and brand it?) other&#39;s ideas, lest they turn into the reacher that Google may one-day become (and that day may be approaching rather quickly).

I suppose it all boils down to Web 2.0 ...
