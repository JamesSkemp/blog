<p>A while back, after visiting the doctor and finding that the pain I was experiencing every once in a while in my hands was probably caused by my cutting off the circulation to the underside of my arm, I started looking at options to keep myself from cutting off circulation, as I noticed I was doing.</p>
<p>I'm not a gel fan, and the foam pads were too stiff, and didn't seem to do much good, so despite my lack of faith in beads (I had a beanbag as a kid, which involved a lot of getting up and fixing it so I was actually sitting on beans once in a while), I decided to purchase one of these.</p>
<p>Wow. Despite my lack of faith this product lived up to its marketing. Due to the number of beads within I'm always resting on top of them when I set my hands/arms down. While I wouldn't go so far as to say they're very good at massaging, they're actually pretty comfortable.</p>
<p>Then we have the secondary benefit of it being a fairly good stress ball, by either picking it up in one or both hands, or digging your fingers into it. For the most part, however, I end up forgetting about it completely, which is a very good thing. (Contrary to what I've seen said elsewhere, I've had no problems with this moving off of my desk or out of place. I only wish it was a little longer, but I suppose that's what the mouse cushions are for ...)</p>
<p>After a few weeks of using it at the office I ended up picking another for at home, and am extremely happy with my purchases.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>
