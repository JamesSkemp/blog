<p>
The no checkout thing is weird. Had someone else (a Mac user) not a) told me about the process and b) told me about the store location, I would c) made the purchase online instead, and not gotten exactly what I think I want (/known about my other options) and d) would have been utterly confused about the checkout process :)

<p>
But, the two people I spoke with while checking out were extremely friendly, and I was amazed by the quality of the store. Wow!
