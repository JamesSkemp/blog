  </header>
  <div class="body">Whenever I think about Medieval Philosophy, from this point on after taking this class, I will also think about religion. When I think about religion I think about God and free will. So, since I need to have a topic for this final analysis, I decided that I should probably take one of these topics, and find some writer who would be the best to analysis in this area. After looking at the articles, I decided that I would take Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Summa Theologica and look at how he answers the question of what the will is, and whether it acts of its own accord.</div>

  <div class="body">This semester, we looked at Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, Tim Crane&rsquo;s Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, and The Cambridge Companion to Husserl. Through these writings we have learned more about the Theory of Intentionality, from two different perspectives, the Analytic Philosophy tradition &ndash; as shown by Corrado and Crane &ndash; and the Phenomenological tradition &ndash; as showcased by Husserl, or, more perhaps more appropriately, the individuals writing on Husserl.</div>

  <div class="body">1. Present Algazali&rsquo;s argument for the incoherence of the philosophers and Averroe&rsquo;s response to it. Also present your own critique. Algazali, in The Incoherence of the Philosophers, argues that &ldquo;what is customarily believed to be cause and what is believed to be an effect is not necessary, according to our opinion; but each of the two [namely, cause and effect] is independent of the other.&rdquo; [1: 283] In other words, while philosophers believe that there exists such a law that if x occurs then y occurs &ndash; that there is a system of cause and effect &ndash; Algazali believes that there is no relationship between cause and effect.</div>

  <div class="body">Francis Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis was the first chosen source to read for this Age of Reason class. Bacon&#39;s work best fits as a beginning reading for various reasons, one of which is the applicability of the book as showcasing the major ideas of the Age of Reason at the beginning of their formation, in many cases. For this paper, I will begin by examining Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis, in a specific area, and then pursuing that area&#39;s progress, or reiteration, in some of the other readings from this age.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">We often hear of the importance of one. This will briefly look at the numbers of just how important one is. After that, I&rsquo;d like to discuss this issue (knowing full well that I will end up going off on a tangent). The importance of one person when there are x people: x people % that one person equals (1/x)*100 1 100 2 50 3 33.3 4 25 5 20 6 16.6 7 14.285714 8 12.5 9 11.1 10 10 11 9.09 12 8.3 13 7.692307 14 7.142857 15 6.6 16 6.25 17 5.8823529411764705 18 5.5 19 5.263157894736842105 20 5 21 4.761904 22 4.54 23 4.347826086956521739130 24 4.16 25 4 26 3.846153 27 3.703 28 3.571428 29 3.4482758620689655172413793103 30 3.3 31 3.225806451612903 32 3.125 33 3.03 34 2.9411764705882352 35 2.857142 With these 35 results, we see that the importance of one, in percent, decreases fairly quickly, and then slowly goes lower.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">Often times we will hear one say to another that they do not believe in God. They will then say, as a way to prove to the other that they are right, that God does not exist, that if God exists then God would have the power to strike him down, as he is a non-believer. Of course, this cannot happen for various reasons, which I will attempt to discuss below.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">In Tim Crane&rsquo;s book, Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, we are given a contemporary look at the Analytic Tradition, and their use of the ideas of Intentionality to come to the truth about perception and thought.&nbsp; Crane attempts to explain to the reader how perception and thought are related, as well as the role of intentionality in relation to perception and thought. For the most part, when we speak of the terms &lsquo;perception&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought&rsquo; we can rely almost solely upon a particular individual.&nbsp; For example, imagine that we have one individual, whom we will call Gavin, looking at some object, which, for simplicity, we will say is a particular can of Dr Pepper sitting in front of him.</div>

  <div class="body">1. According to Augustine, God is not responsible for the existence of evil. What is his argument? Present the argument in detail. In On Free Will, Augustine speaks of man&rsquo;s freedom to will, or make decisions, for himself. He also speaks of evil, and how a man can do evil, as well as where evil comes from. Now, Augustine believes that man is inclined to do Good, which is to follow God and seek out happiness, through virtuous activity, and not through the goods of this physical world.</div>

  <div class="body">The following is a paper written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. Every time I heard someone speak of scholasticism I never quite knew what they meant. Having heard of it in many classes in the philosophy of religion &lsquo;genera&rsquo;, I was convinced that it was something that refers to philosophers who dealt with the philosophy of religion, and specifically in the time period of the medieval era &ndash; especially around the years of St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine.</div>
