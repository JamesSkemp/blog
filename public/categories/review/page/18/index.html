  </header>
  <div class="body">I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie. Other editions may play differently, although since I don&#39;t discuss the audio or video components of this film, my review will stand as-is. This is, by far, one of the most wonderful films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. While I haven&#39;t been much of a Will Ferrell fan in the past, this movie has truly opened my eyes to just how great of an actor he really is.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">While I initially hooked up my Playstation 3 a week ago, when I was posting to the official PS forums today, my second post, I was doing so to recommend a version of the router I&#39;m using. Since both items are pretty popular now, it makes sense to write up a quick guide on them, I suppose. My equipment First off, there&#39;s my setup. I&#39;ve had pretty experiences with Linksys, but poor experiences with Netgear, so Linksys I am.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">In the beginning of this month, I purchased a 32" Sony Bravia. In the two weeks that I've had the television, I've run into a couple of things that I would like the television to offer. In no particular order, they are listed below. Better volume detection Maybe it's because the speakers are better on this tv than my old one, but there's definitely an issue with commercial versus programming volumes.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">Today I purchased a new television, to replace my tried-and-true Philips 20&quot;. After a couple of months of research, and etcetera, I decided to go with a Sony Bravia. Since my previous television was a 20&quot;, purchased back during my sophmore or junior year of college, and still using &#39;tube&#39; technology, I figured it was time to upgrade, especially since I&#39;ve been watching more movies via Netflix, and am planning on purchasing one of the current next-gen video game systems (P3 or 360).</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">I&#39;m a fan of PKD, but this documentary fails in a number of major areas, making it almost useless in its scope. First of all, the animations that are used in place of slides are annoying beyond _, but I suppose if they trimmed those up they&#39;d only have an hour of play time. The music reminded me of Assault on Precinct 13, and while it wasn&#39;t too bad, it was utterly diabolical when it was close to drowning out the interviewed individuals while they spoke.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">I had previously written on how Netflix shipped and received DVDs, for Madison WI. This article continues that one, by discussing Year 2 with Netflix (first year began September 26, 2006). Plan changes On December 2, 2007, I decided to upgrade to the two at-a-time (unlimited)&nbsp;plan. Since my plan begins on the 10th of each month, that means I had to pay an extra $1.26 to upgrade now, instead of for the next month (I figure this way they&#39;ll send a movie out tomorrow morning).</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">As it promises, Steve Krug&#39;s Don&#39;t Make Me Think: 2nd Edition, is a quick, but extremely usable, guide to Web usability and design. The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours total over the days of September 26 and 27, of 2007), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">In January of 2002, I bought a copy of the two volume set of Logical Investigations for a college course regarding major figures in philosophy, or some such. Later that year I picked up a copy of the Ideas, for another course, the next semester. Unfortunately, Husserl remained something of a mystery to me, despite having attempted to make my way through his primary works. With Husserl, part of Routledge&#39;s new series of introductory works on Western philosophers, David Woodruff Smith attempts to give an overview and analysis of what makes Husserl such an &#39;influential philosopher.&#39; With the hope that D.W.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">I had occasion today to read The Hospice, by Robert Aickman (1914-1980). This story was in the collection Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (selected by Marvin Kaye). Unfortunately, I had to go to Google to try to make sense of the story, since Kaye himself suggests that the meaning is rather obscure. A simple G search turned up a result at some site, which itself is rather odd ... in a mysterious way.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">My GitS: 2nd Gig knowledge is a bit rusty, so Solid State Society is definitely going to be one of those &#39;need to watch it at least twice&#39; movies. It seems the movie takes place after 2nd Gig, and therefore, outside of the realm of the other two movies. For two years the Major has been working outside of Section 9, which seems a bit off, since I was under the understanding (perhaps just from the movies) that if they quit, they forfeit pretty much everything ...</div>
