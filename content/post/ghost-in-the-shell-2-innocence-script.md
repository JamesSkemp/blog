<p>Description: Transcript of the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FMI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0006A9FMI" target="_blank">Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</a> (2004) based upon a viewing of the English DVD release, using the English subtitles.</p>
<p>I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is an extremely philosophical movie, so I have decided to watch and type up a transcript of the movie so that I could expand my own knowledge of the film. In the spirit of the Internet/Web, I provide it here as well to aid others.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="http://strivinglife.com/ghost-in-the-shell-script/">Ghost in the Shell - Script</a> for the first movie.</p>

<p>If you notice any problems with the movie&rsquo;s transcript, please just let me know. Also, if you have any comments or thoughts that you&rsquo;d like to share on a particular portion of the movie (or the movie in general), please don&rsquo;t hesitate to share them with the public via the comment system, or send them privately to <strong>strivinglife [at] gmail [dot] com</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, I didn&rsquo;t write the original script, and I respect all copyrights as applicable. I&rsquo;m just a fan of the philosophy of the movie, and since there wasn&rsquo;t a script online at the time of this writing, I figured I could transcribe one (after all, my <a href="/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">Waking Life transcript</a> turned out to be quite the resource) ... I just hope others find it a valuable resource, and a stepping stone towards further discussions on this movie.</p>

<p><strong>Can you help?</strong> Ryan C. asks for movies in a vein similar to <a href="/ghost-in-the-shell-2-innocence-script/">Ghost in the Shell 2</a> and <a href="https://wakinglifemovie.net/">Waking Life</a>). He suggests <cite>Mindwalk</cite> and <cite>My Dinner With Andre</cite> as two such movies. Can you, readers, recommend any other movies like these?</p>
