The following is a review of the DII Home Essential Chevron Luxury Throw for Indoor/Outdoor Use, 48x67, provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Warm and great length, but scratchy and loosing threads

First I have yet to use this blanket outside, and based upon what I've experienced thus far I probably will not. Not because I don't think it can handle it, but rather because I've found it to be perfect for use on my couch when I want to lay down with a book.

The [48x67" DII Home Essential Chevron Luxury Throw for Indoor/Outdoor Use][product] is of a near perfect size for myself, who's about 5 foot 8 or so. It's perfect for covering me while stretching out on my couch.

One downside is that the blanket is a little scratchy. It's something that I've gotten used to, but I don't see myself using this to cover up when it gets warmer and I have more skin showing and therefore in contact with the blanket.

Luckily I was able to get a few colder nights in with the blanket, and while it may not be able to be the only blanket I use during winter, it did keep me fairly warm.

One other thing that I've noticed is in regards to the tassels on the end of the blanket. If you use it cover your entire body you can expect to find these resting in your face. Again, the blanket is of sufficient length that this wasn't that big of an issue. However, what was is that I've lost two of the tassels in the almost month I've used the blanket. Looking at another review, I am a little worried that this might be a sign of future things to come, but at this point I'll just be waiting to see.

Given my minor complaints of the blanket, I give the [48x67" DII Home Essential Chevron Luxury Throw for Indoor/Outdoor Use][product] four of five stars.
