<h3>Does exactly what you&#39;d expect&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016G73PW?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Griffin&#39;s PowerJolt SE</a> for use in my 2007 VW Rabbit, with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLKIHA?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">iPod Classic</a> (80GB). 
</p>
<p>
The Rabbit has a power outlet that is somewhat recessed, so I didn&#39;t think some of the other car chargers would work as well. The design Griffin uses, however, is absolutely perfect, in that only the small top of the plug hangs above. This means all the power in less space then you&#39;d expect. 
</p>
<p>
The product is supposed to charge iPods/iPhones, and it charges my iPod exactly as I&#39;d expect. 
</p>
<p>
It also suggests to offer surge protection, as it has a replaceable fuse, as well as a charge status indicator (the top of the plug changes color). However, I&#39;ve only noticed a light red color, even when my iPod suggests that it is fully charged. 
</p>
<p>
The cable is not straight, but does coil, which is either a good or a bad thing. For me, it just means that I have to stretch it out a bit so my iPod can rest in my center cupholders. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the plug into the iPod seems a little tight - like I experienced with my mom&#39;s Nano. However, I don&#39;t feel this is an issue. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, if I was asked for a product that provided this kind of functionality, I would *definitely* recommend Griffin&#39;s product. The fact that Apple carries them in their stores is also very reassuring. 
</p>
