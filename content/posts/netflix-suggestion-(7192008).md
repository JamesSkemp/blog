<p>
I don&#39;t know if this is a suggestion, or if the information is already available.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d really like to be able to see a complete listing of movies that I&#39;ve rated.
</p>
<p>
A complete listing of movies I&#39;ve rated and that are in my queue is buried in the privacy tab, and I can page through movies that I&#39;ve rated, but there&#39;s no way to get all the movies I&#39;ve rated on one page.
</p>
<p>
Or is there?
</p>
<p>
(What I&#39;d really like to do, and what I&#39;m sure others would like to do, is be able to list these on my site; here&#39;s the movies I&#39;ve rated at Netflix. This helps me and Netflix, I&#39;d think.)
