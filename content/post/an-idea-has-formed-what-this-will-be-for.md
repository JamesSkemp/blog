<p>
After a good deal of thought, most of it sub-conscious, I have decided what it is that I&#39;ll be doing with this WordPress, or &#39;blog&#39;.
</p>
<p>
It took a while, as one will notice by looking at the old posts - it took a great while.  Yet, I believe the wait will have given this a great purpose.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m grabbing this idea from others, but, that&#39;s what the Internet is about - publicly sharing thoughts and ideas.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;ll be writing about being the admin for the StrivingLife.net network.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to post at least once per day.  Hopefully, the one post a day will be interesting, and useful to others.  Think of these posts as a chronicle of the joy of having an actual site, and not just some content on some service&#39;s pages.
</p>
<p>
The first post, which will actually be the third post, will be about me and about the StrivingLife.net network.  Then we jump right in to the wonders of keeping a site going, and making it better.
