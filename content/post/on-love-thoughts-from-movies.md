<p>
The following quotes are from movies. At the moment, it&#39;s just the two, but, more shall surely come.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Look. The supermodel&#39;s a beautiful girl, Will. She can make you dizzy, like you&#39;ve been drinking Jack all morning. She can make you feel high for the greatest commodity known to man - promise, the promise of a better day, the promise of a greater hope, the promise of a new tomorrow. This particular ore can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl - in her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing about life seem OK. The supermodels, Willie? That&#39;s all they are - bottled promise. Scenes from a new day, hope in stiletto heels.&nbsp;
