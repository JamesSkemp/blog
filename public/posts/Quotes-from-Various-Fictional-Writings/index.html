Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to put this stuff into stories, but, until then, I present some of the various snippets of dialog that I have collected&hellip;

<hr />
<ul>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; and it was at that moment that Roberta realized that she was not
    alone.&quot;</li>
    <li>Overheard:<br />
    &quot;&hellip;and that is why frogs are far better then chipmunks.&quot;<br />
    &quot;But Robert, you still do not understand that chipmunks is not an answer&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>Overheard:<br />
    &quot;&hellip;forgetting that there are only three distinct types.&quot;<br />
    &quot;I think that you are forgetting that you do not know what I am talking
    about.&quot;<br />
    &quot;Oh I <em>know</em> what you are talking about, but you do not know what I am talking
    about&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Isn&#39;t there an easy way - to suicide?&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;confronted with this truth he was overcome by a great sadness. It came
    from the depths of him to rush out in a moan from his throat&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;there are many things which need be said, and you may, or may not, be
    the one to say them, or some&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;and that is why you will never know it, because you looked with your
    eyes, and not your mind&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Is it better to live a lie,<br />
    Or know it all and cry?&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;for all those who know not this power will be struck <em>down</em>, <em>down</em> by
    the power that he holds&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;My soul mate&#39;s already <em>dead</em> man, and I didn&#39;t even have the chance to
    meet her&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; and sometimes things happen that way. I do not know if I would call
    that our nature, but&hellip; what do I know?&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Somebody you know is going to turn you in&hellip; Make sure you are prepared
    for when they do&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;I&#39;m a man torn in two&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Have you ever had one of those days when you have absolutely no idea of
    how to answer the question &#39;How are you doing&#39;?&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Yeah? Well my mom thinks I have a nice major&hellip; Well, not exactly her
    phrasing, but&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; but he didn&#39;t stop, the fucker just kept coming at me&hellip; what the
    fuck was I supposed to do? how the fuck was I supposed to know? A man
    doesn&#39;t stop and think in that kind of situation and I am a man&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;It&#39;s not poetry - it&#39;s free prose - it&#39;s thoughts and feelings and ideas
    - it&#39;s all this, and plenty more&quot; [02/13/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; but not everything continues on for as long as that. In fact,
    most of the individuals of the species stop a short time after they start.
    it obviously has something to do with the natural desire to survive - not so
    much as an individual, but as a species&hellip;&quot; [02/14/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; For example, take the case of J. R. Eaton. Eaton, born around
    the turn of the century, was, at the very beginning, greatly influenced by the
    work of his father and, through him, his forefathers. Of course&hellip;&quot;
    [02/14/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; but, Elizabeth is dead, dead by your hands. You may not have
    physically laid a hand upon her, but you have strangled the life out of her -
    her very heart is crushed. You hold your head up, as high as you can get
    it, but inside your back is crooked, your head is held in your hands, you
    knees are bent. Your wails reach my ears - yet as do the sounds of the
    splashing seas. You and your friends, you sit here laughing at a women
    who needs only to &#39;loosen up&#39;. {[But that is the last thing I will do -
    not only for my enemies, but for my friends as well.] - ?} &hellip;&quot;
    [02/14/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip; cannot be discounted on account of his human faults and frailties.
    In fact, looking at many people during this period, we find that he lies
    almost in the middle of the scheme of things, if one could put a scale to such
    things. Instead, one should look at the works that he produced in his
    lifetime. His first story, &#39;The Trampling of Lee Hoover&#39;, fast became a
    cult hit, setting the bar at a high level - which would only be raised higher - was
    written at a somewhat troubling time in his life. You&#39;ll remember from
    our previous conversations that he lived much of his life not only in a state
    of constant depression, but also a state of paranoia. While no one
    really knows when he first began to exhibit the extreme paranoia that would
    lead his life and writings - much like paranoia&#39;s effect upon Philip K. Dick -
    but, there are many hypothesis, none of which can be proved, and few of which
    can be disproved. So, we find that his human faults in fact lead to a
    much better author as a whole. After all, one who has lived an ordinary
    life cannot be said to be the most extraordinary person, and, because of that,
    they cannot be said to be the most interesting writer. Cases, of course,
    exist in which an ordinary man does extraordinary works, but, fortunately, or
    unfortunately, cases such as this are far from regular. &hellip;&quot; [02/14/2003,
    fixed 07/07/2003]</li>
    <li>Saw a man waling down the street and he told me his name was god.
    &quot;God?&quot; I said. &quot;Yes my son&quot; [02/17/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;Em, goth girls have all the fun&quot; [02/21/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;Chad doesn&#39;t know what you are talking about. But, I think that if
    you know what is good for you, you will know what you are talking about&quot;
    [02/21/2003 - I don&#39;t like this one&hellip; it needs something&hellip;]</li>
    <li>Overheard:<br />
    &quot;&hellip; so what do you want me to do? &hellip; how can I make this better? I didn&#39;t mean anything by it, I&#39;m just so used to turning &hellip; &quot; [02/23/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;Downloading music off of the Internet is the same as give terrorist money. Don&#39;t support terrorism&hellip;&quot; [02/25/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;We are on a humanitarian mission. The Iraqi people have only experienced the desert. We are prepared to bring them winter.&quot; [03/12/2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;been a while&#39; she said as we met on the summit of our travels&hellip;&quot; [??.??.2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;and that&#39;s why. Don&#39;t take it personally, it&#39;s not your fault&hellip; per se&hellip; I mean, it&#39;s my fault really. Sorry, but that&#39;s&hellip;&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Familiarity Takes It&#39;s Toll&quot; [04.03.2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;So I told her that to be a god would be to submit yourself to eventual insanity. All of the classic gods are insane in one sense or another. Along with insanity comes an incredible hate for your creations - you want to screw them over. Why? Because it&#39;s fun. That&#39;s why I wouldn&#39;t want to be a god, I told her, because I would end up killing my children, I&#39;d wipe every single one of them out&hellip;&quot; [04.08.2003]</li>
    <li>&quot;&hellip;yet the generalization remains. Mr. Oak, despite the popular opinions of the time, is <em>not</em> what he is made out to be. On the contrary, Mr. Oak is the character who brings out the depth of the other characters. If one pays attention to the conversations that Mr. Oak participates in, one can easily determine who the characters are that the author would like us to pay attention to. Rupert, Clara, Clark and Aman are four characters who we see speaking with Mr. Oak, and each has a pivotal part to play in the novel. One may argue that Aman is not a main character, and does not play a major part in the novel, but, quite to the contrary, Aman plays no minor part in this novel.&quot; [04.14.2003] </li>
    <li>&quot;People&hellip; what fascinating, yet, at the same time, horrifying beings&hellip; You read their thoughts, their words, and&hellip; and you feel&hellip; terrified, yet in love. These are people just like you and me, but their feelings are out and about, while other&#39;s are hidden&hellip; It&#39;s&hellip; it&#39;s something&hellip;&quot; [04.14.2003]</li>
