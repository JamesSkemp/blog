<p>
Good-bye LG UX6000.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had you since August 2004,<br />
and you&#39;ve been a great little phone.
</p>
<p>
Sturdy and dependable,<br />
I didn&#39;t go wrong.
</p>
<p>
Hello LG UX565,<br />
you&#39;re awfully cute.
</p>
<p>
Sleek and simple,<br />
and oh so light.
</p>
<p>
You take pictures and video,<br />
and have nice big buttons.
</p>
<p>

(If I would have got my phone today, instead of yesterday, it would have been 4 years and 2 months ...)
