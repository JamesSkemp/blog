<p>This article is primarily for personal reference.</p>
<p>The Northwind sample database setup scripts can be download from the CodePlex project <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://northwindcommunity.codeplex.com/">Northwind Community Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, that project is dead, but the original script can be found by going to Source Code, browsing the code, and checking in the Original Northwind Scripts directory.</p>
<p>It contains both views and procedures, but there is <a rel="external" href="http://sqlserversamples.codeplex.com/">Microsoft SQL Server Community Projects &amp; Samples</a> page. Sadly, the links on the official Express page no longer work for the sample databases.</p>
