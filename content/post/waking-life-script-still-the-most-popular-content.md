Did you know that the most popular content on this site is the <a href="/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">revised Waking Life movie transcript</a> that I host on this very site?  It&#39;s true, it&#39;s the most visited content on this site.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Of course, having seen Waking Life more than just a couple times, and having watched scenes, and parts of scenes, over and over again, it comes as little surprise to me.  What is surprising is that the movie isn&#39;t an even bigger hit.

Hopefully Linklater&#39;s view on Philip K. Dick&#39;s A Scanner Darkly is equally good.  Of course, if he makes a movie true to Dick&#39;s work, then he&#39;s got a winner on his hand.  And, if the trailer is any sign of the movie, he&#39;s got gold.  Too bad it won&#39;t be out until early July ... but, I suppose that&#39;s how they can keep getting the movies out.
