<p>
Here&#39;s an interesting article out of the Googleplex: <a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html">Google Code: Web Authoring Statistics</a>.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a look at code from December of 2005, and shows some interesting coding mistakes. Too bad more software doesn&#39;t (can&#39;t?) follow W3C standards ...
</p>
<p>
EDIT: It&#39;s great that Google has done this, but I&#39;d like to hope that they&#39;ll continue to do this. As one of the links from Google attests, it&#39;s time for Web developers to look at standards, from the top down, and begin implementing them. If someone isn&#39;t implementating standards, then they need to be helped.

And, the old guides out there that are written in the times of pre-CSS need to get cleaned up as well. But since that&#39;s not going to happen, we&#39;ve got to keep our own code clean.
