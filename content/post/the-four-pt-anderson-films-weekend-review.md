<p>
Thanks to Rob Lumley, I&#39;ll be watching four different P.T. Anderson films over the extended holiday weekend. Brief comments on the first film&nbsp;watched,&nbsp;below. 
</p>
<h3>Hard&nbsp;Eight (1996)</h3>
<p>
Interesting. 
</p>
<p>
In more than a couple of places, I was reminded of Jackie Brown. Lots of dialogue, but even more quiet, giving an emphasis to not only what is said, but what is not. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s slow, which may turn some away, but the story of Sydney is interesting all the same ...

<h3>Boogie Nights (1997)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
Eh. I liked Hard Eight more. I just didn&#39;t care that much about the characters.

<h3>Magnolia (1999)</h3>
<p>
Good, but I feel like I missed something ...

<h3>Punch-Drunk Love (2002)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
Now this is a five-star movie. It had me, much like the main character, up and down, throughout the film. Hoorah!
