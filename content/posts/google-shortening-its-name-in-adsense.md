<p>
After making a post a short time ago (this post moved to rest before it), I ran into an interesting site; in place of &#39;Google&#39; in the AdSense banner text &quot;Ads by Google&quot;, there was the small Google image, used in the address bar or tab, for those browsers that support it.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
This was for a 300x250 banner - the 468x60 also used continued to have &#39;Google&#39; written out.
</p>
<p>
This is an interesting development, and I&#39;m curious as to what else this will bring.
