<div class="warning">
<p>This application has since been updated. <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Version 1.5.3 of iTunes Playlists to Xml is now available for download.</p>
<p>Download <a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_1.5.3.zip">iTunes Playlists to Xml 1.5.3</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing and more information</h3>
<p>If you're new to iTunes Playlists to Xml, I've created a 'product page' for <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">iTunes Playlists to Xml</a> with all the information needed to get started.</p>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>any version of 1.4 or 1.5</strong>&nbsp;you simply need to replace the <strong>iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe</strong> file with the one in the above archive. Your configuration file&nbsp;should be upgraded with the new functionality automatically.</p>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>version 1.3 or earlier</strong>, extract the contents of the zip replacing everything <em>but</em> the iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe.config file; when you start the application after upgrading the configuration file <em>should</em> be automatically upgraded with all new settings. If you get a configuration error, then replace this file with the new version. Remember to update your name in the Settings menu.</p>
<h3>Changes from version 1.5.2</h3>
<p>Version 1.5.3 of iTunes Playlists to Xml adds the ability to always save the output with a particular file name, instead of the default which uses the current date and time.</p>
<p>This option can be set in the settings as the "Always save as" option.</p>
<h3>Features for&nbsp;future releases</h3>
<p>A future release will allow you to change the elements that are output by default via the user interface (it's possible now via the <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml.htm#advanced">command line</a>).</p>
<p>The next version may also require <a rel="external" href="http://smallestdotnet.com/">.NET Framework</a> version 3.5. If you feel strongly about this, please let me know by leaving&nbsp;a comment below.</p>
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>As always, comments and suggestions are appreciated.</p>
