<h3>[3 The Infamous Mystery Hacker]</h3>
<p>
This is a rare pleasure, Mr. Aramaki. What can the Foreign Ministry do for Section 9? 
</p>
<p>
What are these secret talks you&#39;ve scheduled with the Gavel Republic for tomorrow? 
</p>
<p>
The usual. Foreign aid. The new government reopened the request after the revolution. They claim to be more democratic but they&#39;ll probably be as bad as the last bunch. Giving them money they don&#39;t earn will help nobody. They consider it reparation for past exploitation and won&#39;t thank-- 
</p>
<p>
And what will the government do? 
</p>
<p>
The problem is that we have the leader of the old junta here looking for political asylum. 
</p>
<p>
Col. Maless, right? 
</p>
<p>
So, do we throw him out and grant them the aid? Or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid? Not an easy decision to make. Personally, if I could find a politically acceptable reason I&#39;d have the man deported in a heartbeat. 
</p>
<p>
(Aramaki grimaces.) 
</p>
<p>
Oh yes, thanks for your help with that programmer defection. 
</p>
<p>
Nakamura over in Section 6 said he was grateful. After all, we in the diplomatic corps have to keep our hands clean. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
(We see a computerized view of a brain being scanned.) 
</p>
<p>
Accessed. We&#39;ve lost response. How&#39;s her brainwave output look? 
</p>
<p>
Normal. Switching over the virtual experience mode pattern. 
</p>
<p>
(Aramaki:) The Foreign Minister&#39;s interpreter. 23 minutes ago, her cyber-brain was hacked via telephone connection. Just as Foreign Intelligence division predicted the Puppet Master has begun to break into every terminal on the network. Pattern analysis shows a high probability that he&#39;s attempting to disrupt secret talks with Gavel. We&#39;ve placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance. Probably trying to hack her ghost so she&#39;ll kill people at the meeting. 
</p>
<p>
How long till he hacks through her protection and reaches her ghost? 
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s using an old-style HA-3. I&#39;d say about two hours. After that, we&#39;ll have to cut the line to eliminate all risk. 
</p>
<p>
Batou and Ishikawa are in a car, tracing the signal. Rendezvous with them. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The Puppet Master... That phantom hacker, right? 
</p>
<p>
They think he&#39;s an American. Age, sex, personal history... Everything about him is unknown. Since last winter he&#39;s been mainly active in the EC. Internationally wanted on dozens of charges of stock manipulation, spying, political engineering terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy. He&#39;s ghost-hacked so many people to carry out his crimes he&#39;s earned the code name &quot;The Puppet Master.&quot; This is the first instance of him operating in this country. 
</p>
<p>
So, if he&#39;s so hot, why&#39;s he using an old HA-3? 
</p>
<p>
Well, a newer type would be less detectable and be harder to trace. But it could also implicate the former junta leader, Col. Maless. 
</p>
<p>
So he&#39;s using an older type to keep us from suspecting him. 
</p>
<p>
Or somebody else wants us to think that. Maless may just be another pawn in this whole thing. 
</p>
<p>
Now you&#39;re overthinking this. There&#39;s no evidence of that. 
</p>
<p>
Evidence? I just have a whisper... A whisper from my ghost. By the way, are you still using that revolver? Afraid both guns in a two-man team&#39;ll jam up? 
</p>
<p>
I like the Mateba. 
</p>
<p>
Since I depend on your backup, I think stopping power is more important than personal preference. Especially since it&#39;s my ass on the line. Use the Zastaber instead. 
</p>
<p>
Major, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you. Why&#39;d you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police? 
</p>
<p>
Because you&#39;re a guy like you. 
</p>
<p>
Huh? 
</p>
<p>
An honest cop with a clean record. And you&#39;ve got a regular family. With the exception of your cyber-net implants, your brain&#39;s real. No matter how powerful we may be fighting-wise a system where all the parts react the same way is a system with a fatal flaw. Like individual, like organization. Overspecialization leads to death. That&#39;s all.
