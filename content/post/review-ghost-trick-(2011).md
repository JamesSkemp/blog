<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002TDIEDG?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Ghost Trick</a>, released in 2011, for the Nintendo DS.</p></div>

<h3>What a very good game</h3>

<p>A very short while ago I watched a video that featured <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002TDIEDG?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Ghost Trick</a> briefly, and I fell in love with the graphic style of the game. After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.</p>

<p>Throughout this game I found myself saying 'what a great game' aloud, after finding one thing or another that was amazing. While this is the first game of it's type that I think I've played, I don't believe it'll be the last.</p>

<p>A few of the puzzles I had difficulty with, and ended up consulting a guide for the solution, but I'm sure I would have figured them out, had I not been more interested in the story than my pride of completing it alone.</p>

<p>The story is definitely the strongest aspect of the game, although the art style and gameplay are not too far behind. With a few twists and turns, and a fantastic (and slightly tear-invoking) conclusion, Ghost Trick will stay with me for quite some time.</p>

<p>I can easily give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002TDIEDG?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Ghost Trick</a> a full five of five stars.</p>
