<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of Cash N Guns Second Edition, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p></div>

<h3>Fun with a good group</h3>

<p>When initially reading over the instructions for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KU10OUU?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Cash N Guns</a> I wasn't sure how it would actually play. The idea of robbers trying to split the loot from a heist is pretty easy to understand, but would it play out fairly?</p>

<p>Having now played the game in a group of five I think it went fairly well. With the exception of one person (who had played before and knew the rules), everyone else had either known each other for a few months, or in the case of two people, for quite a while. While those two did end up going back and forth, it ultimately didn't have much of an impact upon the group as a whole.</p>

<p>I was going to bring this to my normal group, but one individual has an issue with the inclusion of the foam guns, and would have skipped out had we played. Something to keep in mind depending upon the group, as the game does involve pointing a foam gun at another player, and either shooting them, or not.</p>

<p>Speaking of the set's pieces, I found them to be of a very high quality, and they seem they'll hold up against abuse as any other game would. However, I did find that the drawings at the bottom of the box, while nice, kept throwing me off; I kept expecting them to be pieces of the game, and not part of the box.</p>

<p>Ultimately I give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KU10OUU?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Cash N Guns</a> 4 stars of 5. The game is simple enough to play in about 30 minutes, but the number of required players (to make it fair and fun) and the fact that my group can't play it because of the guns/shooting is unfortunate.</p>
