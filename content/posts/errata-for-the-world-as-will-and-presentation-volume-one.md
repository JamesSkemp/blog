<p>
Hello, 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I noticed a very minor mistake in Volume One of The World As Will and Presentation, translated by Richard E. Aquila. I&#39;m of the tech-industry now, where errata is a necessary evil, so ... I thought I&#39;d point it out, just in case any other fixes need be made in later printings/editions. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;On page 396, in the last sentence of the first full paragraph, we have this text: 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right the kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;This should in fact be (emphasis my own): 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right *to* kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If this should be forwarded to someone else, please just let me know. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Thanks! 
</p>
