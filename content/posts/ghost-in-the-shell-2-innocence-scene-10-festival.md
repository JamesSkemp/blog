&quot;You sure have gotten informal, Lin. Since when do you skip the &#39;Sir&#39;?&quot;
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
&quot;I haven&#39;t forgotten the debt I owe you.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;&#39;The less one forgets the less one can remember?&#39;&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Oh, c&#39;mon, Batou... Sir.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Now you want to butter me up with &#39;Sir&#39;.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Please, forgive me, I beg you. I beseech you.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Know a guy called Kim?&quot;<!--adsense-->
</p>

<p>
&quot;Never heard of him. Actually, they&#39;re a dime a dozen up this way.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;I&#39;m just looking for a particular one.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;We got loyalty even in my line.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;&#39;There&#39;s loyalty that protects secrets and loyalty that protects the truth.&#39; You can&#39;t serve both masters, so which loyalty is yours?&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;They say there&#39;s no truth without secrets.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;I&#39;ll ask you again, do you know a guy called Kim?&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Never heard of him. Actually, they&#39;re a dime a dozen...&quot;
