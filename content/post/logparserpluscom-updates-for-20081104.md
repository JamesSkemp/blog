<p>
<a href="http://logparserplus.com/">Log Parser Plus</a> was updated last night, during the election coverage, with the following changes:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<div>
	All functions now have descriptions (pulled almost completely from the included help file).
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Expressions have been added.
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Visit <a href="http://logparserplus.com/">LogParserPlus.com</a> for all of this information, and more, as it becomes available.
</p>
<p>
(Next addition will be samples for the functions, and the start of a fleshed-out queries listing.)
