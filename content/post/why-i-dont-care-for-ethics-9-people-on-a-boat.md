<p>
Since college I have disliked ethics. However, I couldn&#39;t explain why.
</p>
<p>
On December 10, 2008, at approximately 10:04 PM, I turned on the lamp next to my bed and wrote the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	9 people on a boat that can only hold 8. What do you do? 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even then I knew the answer.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	Morally, I think the answer is you (me) jump off the boat. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Maybe I was reading too much Schopenhauer, but this seems like the only answer you can give.
</p>
<p>
Even if you were given information about the 8 other people, you can&#39;t make a decision about why anyone else should jump or be thrown from the boat. But, here&#39;s some other arguments that one might give. 
</p>
<h3>Other Arguments<br />
</h3>
<p>
Throw off the oldest. After all, they&#39;re the nearest to death.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the youngest.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the one who isn&#39;t married and doesn&#39;t have children.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the one who can&#39;t have children. 
</p>
<p>
Throw off the atheist.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the christian.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the republican.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the democrat.
</p>
<p>
Vote on who should be thrown off.
</p>
<p>
Pick straws.
</p>
<p>
Throw off the stupidest. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Despite all these options, there is truly only one that can be picked, and may in fact lead to another because of it; allow the first to jump off to stay off. 
</p>
<p>
Am I wrong? Is there any other way to solve this dilemma?
</p>
<p>
If it is the only way, can it be used to solve all other questions? What if you&#39;re the only doctor? Or the only one who has survived in such a situation before? Or the only one strong enough to get the survivors back?
</p>
<p>
And this is why I don&#39;t care for, and even dislike, ethics. 
</p>
