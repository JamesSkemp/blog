      <title>If Firefox recommends ad blocking software ...</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/If-Firefox-recommends-ad-blocking-software/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The other day I installed YSlow on my home machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I did so I noticed that they were recommending the major ad blocking add-on, but I didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reading an article that&amp;nbsp;questioned again (id est, old news)&amp;nbsp;whether Chrome would strain the Google/Mozilla relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the ad blocking add-on blocks Google ads, I wonder if instead of Chrome, it&amp;#39;s these recommended add-ons that are causing the strain. If you were Google, would you want your ads blocked?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I checked a few moments ago and am not seeing the recommendation any longer, so I can&amp;#39;t reproduce at the moment, but nonetheless ...
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Current, major, browsers</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Current-major-browsers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2008 14:30:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Current-major-browsers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Do users know that they&amp;#39;re not using the current version of their browser? While many browsers will check for updated versions (Firefox, for example), some do not. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anywho, I&amp;#39;ve decided, looking at the numbers, that I would start adding a check on my sites to alert users if there browser is out of date, and tell them where they can get an updated version. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that I refer to the desktop version of these browsers, and mention only the major browsers. From personal experience, I highly recommend Opera&amp;#39;s mobile browser(s). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recBrowserIE&#34;&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current version:&lt;/strong&gt; 7.0&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous version:&lt;/strong&gt; 6.0&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming version:&lt;/strong&gt; 8.0&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Find out more and download&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/21/2008:&lt;/strong&gt; After looking through my logs, I found a couple of instances where the MSIE 6 and MSIE 7 instances show up in the user-agent, as well as MSIE&amp;nbsp;6 and 8. This seems to be with users who have installed standalone versions of Internet Explorer. If you&amp;#39;re using a newer version of IE, but are seeing a message about using an older version, that may be the issue. See &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://techpatterns.com/forums/about1028.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; for more information. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recBrowserFF&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current version:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.0&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous version:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.0 (supported through mid-December 2008)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming version:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://getfirefox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Find out more and download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safari&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current version:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous version:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming version:&lt;/strong&gt; unknown&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/safari/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Find out more and download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recBrowserC&#34;&gt;Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current version:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.0&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous version:&lt;/strong&gt; 0.4&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming version:&lt;/strong&gt; unknown&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/chrome&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Find out more and download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recBrowserO&#34;&gt;Opera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current version:&lt;/strong&gt; 9.6&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous version:&lt;/strong&gt; 9.5&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming version:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;unknown &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opera.com/browser/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Find out more and download&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other browsers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Netscape&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For quite a while Netscape (Navigator)&amp;nbsp;was an extremely popular browser. However, it is no longer actively supported. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you continue to use Netscape most people will recommend that you upgrade to Firefox. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Browser environments for testing</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Browser-environments-for-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2008 22:40:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Browser-environments-for-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;a href=&#34;http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/How-to-really-compact-Virtual-PC-hard-drives.aspx&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned using virtual machines for testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the three virtual machines that I feel cover the most options for browser testing (on Windows):&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the top 10 browsers for this site, using data from Google Analytics, we have; Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Mozilla, Opera, Playstation 3, Konqueror, SeaMonkey, and Camino.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of those, Internet Explorer and Firefox, obviously, account for the largest amount of traffic, at about 86% of all visits. Safari is a respectable 6.6%, Chrome at about 2.7%, Mozilla at 2.1%, and Opera at 1.8%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some&amp;nbsp;may think&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;m a bit&amp;nbsp;off, but I&amp;nbsp;consider Opera a fairly good browser, while Mozilla doesn&amp;#39;t much concern me. So, that gives us our top five browsers, all of which&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be installed on Windows.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, any&amp;nbsp;test&amp;nbsp;environment for current versions of browsers (on Windows), should include the following (in order of importance).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Internet Explorer 7
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Firefox 3
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Safari 3
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Chrome 0
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Opera 9
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s talk that Chrome may replace Firefox, if Google stops supporting Mozilla, so while Chrome may have low usage numbers, it&amp;#39;s fairly standards-compliant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is also why I feel that not including Opera would be a very big mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This rounds out our first virtual machine to 5 unique browsers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous versions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it would be great if it wasn&amp;#39;t the case, you&amp;#39;ll always need to support older versions of popular browsers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, looking at Google Analytics for this site, almost 25% of Internet Explorer users are using version 6. Firefox, which supposedly has some issues in version 3, that are keeping users back in version 2, is about the same, with 75% of users on version 3.0.3 or 3.0.4 (I suppose there may be some overlap there).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most other browsers don&amp;#39;t actively support so many previous versions, which means that a virtual environment for past versions of browsers can stick with the following.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Internet Explorer 6
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Firefox 2
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upcoming versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This virtual machine is really focused on browsers currently in beta, or that may otherwise not be in the top listing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Primarily, that means the following should almost certainly be included.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    Internet Explorer 8
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s right, Internet Explorer 8. That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;d absolutely need, especially looking at stats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, to a great extent, Chrome, like most of Google&amp;#39;s other &lt;strike&gt;products&lt;/strike&gt; applications is truly a beta browser (and one that I&amp;#39;ve had numerous issues with, probably due to that fact) and that might suggest that it should truly be installed in this environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about Linux and Mac?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The top browsers for Linux, again according to this site, are Firefox and Mozilla, which should&amp;nbsp;function the same as they are on Windows (and, again, I consider Firefox and Mozilla to be basically the same). It&amp;#39;s extremely easy, and free, to get started with any number of Linux environments, but I just don&amp;#39;t know that it makes all that much sense. (Keep reading for the clarification of this statement.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Mac&amp;nbsp;we have Safari and Firefox. The latter should be very similar to the Windows version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Safari Apple was kind enough to give Windows users this browser. As to whether it&amp;#39;s the same as the Mac version, well, it looks very similar. But, unless you&amp;#39;re willing to pay the Apple premium, the Windows version should suffice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For these reasons, basic Web development doesn&amp;#39;t need to dive too deep into Linux and Mac environments.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mobile browsers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But what about browsers on mobile devices?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer have mobile versions available (in the case of Opera, they have two), which will definitely change the output of your site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To some extent &lt;a href=&#34;http://words.strivinglife.com/lynx/&#34;&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; fills this hole by providing a text version of your site, and therefore might make sense installed on a virtual machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The standard Opera browser also provides a mobile-like &amp;#39;emulator&amp;#39; for your site, by way of the Small View functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, for the mobile version of Internet Explorer (which won&amp;#39;t be tracked by Analytics, as it doesn&amp;#39;t support JavaScript (speaking of Windows Mobile 6)) accessing an emulator is not quite as easy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to the solution, I can&amp;#39;t say I can provide one, but as we move more and more towards mobile devices, perhaps we&amp;#39;ll be virtualization for these environments much more readily available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Above I&amp;#39;ve suggested three virtual environments, for Web site development. For the majority of projects, I think having current versions of the top three browsers - Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - would be quite enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think? What do you develop for?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. Of course, I realize that if you were going to create&amp;nbsp;a Flash or Silverlight application, you&amp;#39;d naturally want to test on both Mac and Linux (or if your app becomes popular, you&amp;#39;ll get some backlash on Slashdot). At that point what you&amp;#39;re really testing is the environment, and not just the browser. But, for the &amp;#39;majority&amp;#39; of Web sites, I personally feel that virtual Mac and Linux environments are unnecessary. Compare this to my feelings a number of years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Four-working-browsers-(at-least).aspx&#34;&gt;before Safari was available for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and you&amp;#39;d see a different view.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. I also recommended Lynx and Netscape in that post, but no longer see that as necessary, entirely.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firebug: Don&#39;t enable for every site</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Firebug-Dont-enable-for-every-site/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2008 20:51:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Firebug-Dont-enable-for-every-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
After a deal of searching, I&amp;#39;ve finally discovered why my Firefox browser was crashing so often. So often, in fact, that I have Internet Explorer 7 a chance (and it showed how much of a fight it can now put up).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The short story: don&amp;#39;t enable Firebug for all sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Gmail has recently been warning about this, stating that slow-downs are likely. One config setting, &lt;strong&gt;javascript.options.strict&lt;/strong&gt;, when set to true, can also cause issues with Google AdSense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;ve switched that to false, and only enabled Firebug for the sites that matter (the last wasn&amp;#39;t necessary after changing the option, but it was nonetheless a good idea), I&amp;#39;m back and rolling with Firefox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;ve been away for so long, though, I wonder if I should just uninstall all the versions I&amp;#39;ve got on my computer and just install Firefox 3 ...&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gmail and Firefox 2.0.0.5 - issues with JavaScript?</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Gmail-and-Firefox-2005-issues-with-JavaScript/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2007 12:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Gmail-and-Firefox-2005-issues-with-JavaScript/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Over the past couple of days I&amp;#39;ve noticed issues with the Inbox view of Gmail being extremely slow on Firefox (2.0.0.5, the current version).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Disabling JavaScript makes the load much faster (naturally), but even switching to Internet Explorer (7) works (with JS on).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Firefox 2.0.0.5 already having a security issue, I wonder if updating was a good decision in this case. Perhaps 2.0.0.5 was released a bit too quickly?&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing Sun&#39;s Java Development Kit 5.0 Update 12 on Ubuntu 7.04</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Installing-Suns-Java-Development-Kit-50-Update-12-on-Ubuntu-704/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2007 19:21:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Installing-Suns-Java-Development-Kit-50-Update-12-on-Ubuntu-704/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t have much desire to update from the repositories all the time, for whatever reason. Supposedly, if you run Eclipse from the download manager on Ubuntu, you can expect one slow experience.  So ... time to start by installing Sun&amp;#39;s Java.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I read varying ways on how to do this, but this is what worked for me, using Ubuntu 7.04, fully up-to-date, as of June 11, 2007, 7:00 PM, CST.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, I downloaded the current version of JDK 5.0 from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp, for Linux (jdk-1_5_0_12-linux-i586.bin), saving it to the desktop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then right clicked on the bin file, and under Permissions allowed execute rights.  Elsewhere I saw that this should be made into a deb file, but another said bin was fine, so ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once spacebar, spacebar, spacebar-ing through the agreement, I agreed and it extracted to /home/strivinglife/
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Terminal, I cd /home/strivinglife, followed by sudo mv jdk1.5.0_12 /usr/lib (which moved the entire directory).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jdk1.5.0_12/bin/java 300
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
sudo update-alternatives --config java, and then selected the jdk I just installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also did &lt;span class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;sudo ln -s /usr/lib/Java6u1/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins&lt;/span&gt; since http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml was bombing.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Initial thoughts on moving Firefox settings from Windows to Ubuntu</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Initial-thoughts-on-moving-Firefox-settings-from-Windows-to-Ubuntu/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 17:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Initial-thoughts-on-moving-Firefox-settings-from-Windows-to-Ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This past Friday, I installed Ubuntu 6.06, upgraded it to 6.10, upgraded it to 7.04. I didn&amp;#39;t have too much time to actually use it this weekend, but I&amp;#39;m beginning to, attempting to move towards using it almost exclusively for day-to-day stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most used software? Firefox, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using FEBE for a while to backup my profile, so it was time to give it a try actually doing a restore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I followed the necessary instructions to create a new profile, namely starting the profile manager (cd ~/.mozilla/firefox followed by firefox -ProfileManager) and creating a new profile, the actual restore didn&amp;#39;t work too well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I switched back to Windows, backed up everything individually (not the entire profile, as I was doing) and then began restoring my usernames and passwords.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which didn&amp;#39;t work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I manually replaced the necessary files. Not wanting to try it again, I did the same for the cookies file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem seems to stem from the fact that the directory structure has changed, and a number of my extensions appear to use the directory structure to function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I just need to figure out how to remove the extra kernels when I initially boot up (I&amp;#39;ve still got Windows XP Pro installed on a partition).
&lt;/p&gt;

After a number of Google searches, I&amp;#39;ve been unable to find a listing of what browsers support what versions of JavaScript.  The few sites I did find were AnyBrowser.com and Mozilla.org.  Unfortunately, the information they provide is pretty focused.  In this article I&amp;#39;ll be going over this information, and trying to dig up more.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.anybrowser.com/javascript.html&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;AnyBrowser.com&lt;/a&gt; provides information for IE 2 to IE 5, Netscape 2 to Netscape 6, and AOL 3 to 5.  This covers JavaScript 1.3 (IE 5 and AOL 5) and JavaScript 1.4 (Netscape 6).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:About&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;Mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; provides information for JavaScript 1.0 to JavaScript 1.7, but only for Netscape and Mozilla/Firefox.  JavaScript 1.5 is Navigator 6 and Mozilla 0.6x-0.9x, JavaScript 1.6 is Firefox 1.5, and JavaScript 1.7 is Firefox 2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, JavaScript 1.4 is listed as n/a on Mozilla, and Netscape 6 under JavaScript 1.5, but AnyBrowser has 6 under 1.4 ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the Web as my guide, I&amp;#39;ve determined two ways that I believe will test for JavaScript 1.6 and JavaScript 1.7 support, based upon the following two pages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.6&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For JavaScript 1.6, I&amp;#39;ll be using the following code snippet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    var num = 15;&lt;br /&gt;
    document.write(String.replace(num, /5/, &amp;#39;2&amp;#39;) + &amp;quot; (should be &amp;#39;12&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&amp;quot;);
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For JavaScript 1.7, I&amp;#39;ll be using this code, as well as the previous code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    var x = 5;&lt;br /&gt;
    var y = 0;&lt;br /&gt;
    document.write( let(x = x + 10, y = 12) x+y + &amp;quot; (should be &amp;#39;27&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&amp;quot;);&lt;br /&gt;
    document.write(x+y + &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&amp;quot;);
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The testing page is available on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.cfdeveloper.co.uk/javascript_text.cfm&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(this.href);return false;&#34;&gt;CFDeveloper site&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, if you know of any code that I can use to test JavaScript 1.5 and 1.4 support, please post or email to me, so I can add that to my testing page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, if you can test a different browser/version, please also post your results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My testing of Firefox 2.0.0.1, Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11, and Opera 9.10.  Since the current version of Netscape uses either IE or FF for rendering, I&amp;#39;ve skipped any testing of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Firefox 2.0.0.1&lt;/strong&gt; displays one line for JavaScript 1.5 and less.  These are simple document.write()s, so they should display in most browsers.  Version information is passed through language, not the type, and the type is text/javascript.  In addition, it displays the scripts for 1.6 and 1.7 whether the type is text/javascript or application/javascript, and the version is stated.  For 1.6, it doesn&amp;#39;t display the 1.7 code if the type is text/javascript, with no version.  It does for 1.6.  So, 1.6 has three groups of two lines, while 1.7 has two groups of four lines.  From what I can tell, this is expected behaviour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Opera 9.10&lt;/strong&gt; have the same display for this page.  Through JavaScript 1.5, they each have one line for each - which is to be expected.  For 1.6, they have a single line, which is the first, and simple, document.write() of some text.  No version is passed, and the type is set to text/javascript.  At this point, nothing else is displayed.  For 1.7, nothing is displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If, for 1.6, we change &amp;lt;script language=&amp;quot;javascript1.6&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;script language=&amp;quot;javascript1.6&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;application/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;, only Opera keeps the initial document.write for 1.6.  Internet Explorer displays nothing under the 1.6 heading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based upon this initial testing, it appears that application/javascript, and setting the version in the type, is not supported by the current version of Internet Explorer.  In addition, Firefox is the only one of the three browsers tested that supports up to JavaScript 1.7.  Based upon how IE and Opera behaved with the JavaScript 1.6 test, I&amp;#39;d say that there is no support for 1.6 features, but that doesn&amp;#39;t stop them from giving it a go.  If they run into a problem, they appear to quit looking through the script block.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d be very interested in documentation regarding this, so if you know more, please do post what you can share.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three reasons Microsoft Firefox is a hoax</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Three reasons Microsoft Firefox is a hoax, in order of when I spotted them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s better now ... like seriously ...&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2) Site Ground banner in the bottom left corner. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3) Create a better video, eh? Microsoft doesn&amp;#39;t need to reuse the same video they used elsewhere. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4) Free email address?&amp;nbsp; How 90s/early 00s ... 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/14/ms_firefox/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Register: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/14/ms_firefox/&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firefox 1.5.0.7 released today</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Firefox-1507-released-today/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2006 20:47:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Firefox-1507-released-today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Firefox 1.5.0.7 was released today.&amp;nbsp; Once again, I found out about this by seeing a site mention it, instead of my browser notifying me ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ah well.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s recommended that you download, so go do it!&amp;nbsp; Note that the partial download failed for me.&amp;nbsp; Firefox actually had to download a 6.1 MB file to update Firefox, instead of the under 600 KB file it initially downloaded.&amp;nbsp; While I was at it, I checked my Extensions for updates, which I also recommend you do as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And for those people still using Firefox 1.0.x - why?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Four working browsers (at least)</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Four-working-browsers-%28at-least%29/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2006 21:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Four-working-browsers-%28at-least%29/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s just something about having four different browsers on your computer, to say the least.  I do believe I&amp;#39;ve Lynx installed as well, but it&amp;#39;s hardly used these days ... for better or worse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Firefox 1.5.0.6&lt;br /&gt;
Internet Explorer 7.0.5450.4 (i.e., 7.0 Beta 3)&lt;br /&gt;
Opera 9.01-8552&lt;br /&gt;
Netscape 8.1
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Best of all?  My site displays great in all four.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are other browsers to test, of course, but the question is whether it&amp;#39;s really necessary to do so.  Both Flock and Mozilla seem like a waste to install, since they (like Netscape) are so much fluff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lynx is actually a pretty good browser for a developer, and what do you know, I do have a version from 10/2005 on my computer (2.8.5rel1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Want a copy?  Download it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://strivinglife.net/lynx/&#34;&gt;http://strivinglife.net/lynx/&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I had a Mac, I&amp;#39;d test my site with Safari, but alas I do not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If I had a Linux machine that connected to the Internet (perhaps fairly soon ...) then I would test Konqueror and the like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The lessons are two-fold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) If you&amp;#39;re working on a site, test it in multiple browsers.  Honestly, with today&amp;#39;s world, there&amp;#39;s no reason people shouldn&amp;#39;t upgrade to the newest version of their preferred browser.  Not only do you get better security, but you also get a better browsing experience.  I recommend Firefox, but no matter which browser you choose, if it&amp;#39;s up-to-date, and still being supported (i.e., it&amp;#39;s not a dead browser, but patched to the latest version), it&amp;#39;s okay in my book (some are just better than others).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2) Keep your browser up-to-date.  You don&amp;#39;t need to have the bleeding edge beta releases (in fact, you probably don&amp;#39;t want to either), but at least keep your browser fully patched.  Don&amp;#39;t like how they upgraded the browser in a future release?  It&amp;#39;s not only selfish to keep using that old version, but also dangerous.  And you can always switch to a browser that allows more customization (like Firefox).
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build your own Firefox extension</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 18:38:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Build-your-own-Firefox-extension/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a great little guide over at webmonkey that discusses how to build your own Firefox extension.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://webmonkey.com/webmonkey/06/25/index3a.html?tw=programming&#34;&gt;http://webmonkey.com/webmonkey/06/25/index3a.html?tw=programming&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s also two other guides that the above points to.  One at &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.borngeek.com/firefox/toolbar-tutorial/&#34;&gt;Born Geek&lt;/a&gt;, and another at &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.xulplanet.com/tutorials/xultu/&#34;&gt;XUL Planet&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Essential Firefox extensions for the Web producer/developer</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Essential-Firefox-extensions-for-the-Web-producerdeveloper/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2006 20:28:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Essential-Firefox-extensions-for-the-Web-producerdeveloper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a handful of extensions for Firefox that I found absolutely necessary in my day-to-day Web production and development. Below, I&amp;#39;ve outlined the essentials, as well as those that are near the top of the crop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please note that my current setup is Windows, with Firefox 1.5.0.2. After each extension, I&amp;#39;ve listed the current version, at the time of this writing. I cannot speak for any versions before or after those listed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Web Developer (version 1.0.2)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interested in creating content on the Web? Without these extension, expect to spend more time than necessary tracking down bugs and flaws in layout, and so much more. Chris Pederick&amp;#39;s extension is the only extension you really need to install - and without it, no Web producer&amp;#39;s/developer&amp;#39;s Firefox installation is complete.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. HTML Validator (version 0.7.9)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re interested in valid code, than Marc&amp;#39;s extension is an absolute must-have. If you&amp;#39;re not, but you&amp;#39;re a Web producer or developer, it&amp;#39;s time to start getting interested. Install this extension and see what&amp;#39;s going on, without having to check the W3C all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. The rest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Honestly, that&amp;#39;s the only two extensions which are absolutely essential for a Web producer or developer. Anything other than these two are going to be specific to user preference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, IE Tab (1.0.9) is pretty nice to use, but it&amp;#39;s really not the essential. Live HTTP Headers (0.12) and Header Monitor (0.3.4) are also really nice extensions, but again not essential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A9 SiteInfo (1.0) is for a niche audience, since the file necessary for this to work just isn&amp;#39;t implemented that often.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attention Recorder (0.64) have great potential, but until I can start seeing my data, it&amp;#39;s only taking hard drive space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve heard raves about Greasemonkey, but have yet to really work with it. Part of me hates to install it, because I&amp;#39;m not too big on the idea of fixing other people&amp;#39;s problems. If I visit a site that&amp;#39;s got major problems, I&amp;#39;m going to send an email to the Webmaster, not fix it if I find the site useful. Likewise, I&amp;#39;m going to block ads, as I use them, and know that they bring in a bit of change. If you can make $100 a year, you&amp;#39;ve got a good host paid for for that span of time ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, there&amp;#39;s plenty of extensions out there, that I haven&amp;#39;t tried (and a number I&amp;#39;ve tried but removed because they just weren&amp;#39;t getting used). So, if you think you&amp;#39;re using an extension that an essential, leave a comment and let me know what you&amp;#39;re using, and why it&amp;#39;s an essential.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attention: Where do you put it?</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Attention-Where-do-you-put-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2006 19:11:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Attention-Where-do-you-put-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
In some way, I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.AttentionTrust.org/&#34;&gt;AttentionTrust.org&lt;/a&gt;.  Basically, AttentionTrust operates under the principle that your attention is both yours, and of worth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What really brought me in has an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.attentiontrust.org/node/153&#34;&gt;Attention as a Backup Identity&lt;/a&gt;.  Reading this, I&amp;#39;m struck by a number of things.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1) Web 2.0 advocates are a lot like philosophers - they both can reference science fiction as the future.  There are, from what I&amp;#39;ve seen, no groups of individuals online that reference science fiction more.  Of course, the Internet is extremely connected with science fiction, in that it allows the almost instantaneous sharing of information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2) &amp;quot;That which we own ends up owning us.&amp;quot;  All too often, especially with the youth, but certainly not limited to them, there&amp;#39;s a problem with the connection between their Internet personality and their real personality.  MySpace is a great example, where not only do you live in a community, you can die into one as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &amp;quot;As we establish multiple online identities and avatars, we increasingly run the risk of suffering a catastrophic loss of identity.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Errr ... kinda, depending upon how we read this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only loss of identity we have is that we&amp;#39;re creating multiple identities online, and often a different personality online.  Like some games, we become so focused on who are in relation to the game, or within the game, that we are no longer anything outside of the game.  In short, remove that which we have connected, or focused, upon, and we cannot determine what we are anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We exist not only as a part of the communities we are a part of, but individually outside of them.  It&amp;#39;s important to remember this.  Just because an online community disappears, doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that I disappear.  Likewise, just because you leave a community, doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that the community disappears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, I downloaded the Attention Recorder extension for Firefox, and signed up at Root Vaults to host my data.  However, I&amp;#39;ve yet to find any information on when this data is uploaded ...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyways, once again, it sounds both interesting and promising.  More on this as things progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
