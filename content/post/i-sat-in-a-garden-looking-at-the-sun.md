<ul>
	<li>I sat in a garden, looking at the sun</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I beckoned to it, &#39;come down and we&#39;ll have some fun&#39;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>But the sun would not come, and it sat there in it&#39;s lofty height</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I called to it, &#39;who do you think you are&#39;</li>
	<li>You lofty sun sitting so high in the sky</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&#39;You cannot stay there forever,&#39; came my reply</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>And with that a tower was started, so that the sun would come down</li>
	<li>Whether it desired it or not, it would come down</li>
</ul>

Inspired by the music of the Doors...
