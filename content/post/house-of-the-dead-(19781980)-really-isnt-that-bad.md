One of the most commonly used hooks in scary stories is the idea that the main character is deceased, but doesn&#39;t know it.  As soon as I read the description for the movie The House of the Dead, I pictured the three young boys from Tales from the Hood (1995) and Clarence Williams III (all-around great actor for this genre - see also his role in Miami Vice (in season one or two)).<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Anyways, if you look at the IMDB, this movie sucks.  And, if you go by the alternate title of Alien Zone, you&#39;d be right.  However, while this movie uses core elements, found in many other movies and stories, this movie is nonetheless pretty darn good.

For this and other B-movies, Mill Creek Entertainment offers a 50 Movie Pack, containing 12 DVDs (almost 74 hours).  You can pick up the collection for around $20 at ShopKo.  By the way, the Horror and Sci-Fi collections are true B-movies.  Most of the ones I watched were semi-poor quality black and white.  However, Carnival of Souls was in the former collection, which was actually quite good.

Anyways, the point of the story is; people who leave comments on the IMDB don&#39;t always know what they&#39;re talking about.
