The following is a review of [Galiva Men's Cotton ExtraSoft No Show Cushion Socks][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## I'll stick with my Hanes

I'm pretty brand loyal, but when I had the opportunity to try out a pair of Galiva socks, I decided to give it a try. After all, it has been a couple of years since I've tried anything else.

Initially I was a little impressed, since the socks came in a hard box. However, that's about as far as things went.

The socks themselves feel fine enough, but the length seemed a little off, with the socks either bunching slightly at the sole or riding up uncomfortably at the back. Eventually I figured out where I could stop the socks in order to minimize the slight discomfort.

Beyond that, I didn't feel much of a difference between them and the Hanes I usually wear.

However, my next impression was after the socks had been washed; it has been years since I've seen socks look so dirty. In the same environment, my usual socks either washed clean or didn't get as dirty, while the Galiva socks ended up looking like I had worn them for a few days, without washing them, instead of only the one day and post-wash I was actually seeing them after.

So, I'm not very impressed by [Galiva Men's Cotton ExtraSoft No Show Cushion Socks][review]. They don't offer a comfort experience any better than the Hanes socks I usually wear, and they seem to get dirtier. Two of five stars.
