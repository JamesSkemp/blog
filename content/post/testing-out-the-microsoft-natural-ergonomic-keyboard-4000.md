Just some dummy content while using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I tried it with both &#39;extenders&#39; up when typing the below.

Hello I would like to welcome you to the second Annual Convention on the ergonomics of keyboards. If you would please turn your attention to the right, you&#39;ll notice that we&#39;ve done away with all the formalities and gone with simple dishes. I hope this is to your liking. 
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve also removed all meat from the table which means that you won&#39;t see hide or heel - so to speak - of either of those. 
</p>
<p>
I would like to thank all of you for joining us today.
