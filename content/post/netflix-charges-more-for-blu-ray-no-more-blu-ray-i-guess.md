Granted, it&#39;s only a dollar more, but in this economy ...

<blockquote>
	<p>
	Dear James,
	</p>
	<p>
	As you may know, Blu-ray movies are more expensive than standard definition movies. As a result, we&#39;re going to start charging $1 a month (plus applicable taxes), in addition to your monthly membership charge, for unlimited access to Blu-ray movies.
	</p>
	<p>
	The additional charge for unlimited Blu-ray access will be automatically added to your next billing statement on or after November 5th, 2008 and will be referenced in your Membership Terms and Details. If you wish to continue getting Blu-ray movies for $1 a month more, you don&#39;t need to do anything. If not, you can remove Blu-ray access anytime by visiting Your Account at the Netflix website.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you have questions about this change or need any assistance, please call us anytime at 1-888-638-3549.
	</p>

Now I could stick with it and drop it before November 5, but so that I don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s gone.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if this is $1 for all plans, or if it is based upon your plan.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunate that I have to drop it, but ...
