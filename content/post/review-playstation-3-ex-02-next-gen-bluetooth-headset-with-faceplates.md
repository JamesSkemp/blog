<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ASOLLM?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">PlayStation 3 EX-02 Next Gen Bluetooth Headset with Faceplates</a>, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p></div>

<h3>External speaker is key</h3>

<p>I've tried two different microphones before this headset: the one that came with Warhawk and the PlayStation 3 camera, and since I rarely play multiplayer games, and PlayStation players are less likely to have microphones that Xbox 360 players, both were just fine.</p>

<p>But when I saw the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ASOLLM?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">EX-02</a> available on Amazon Vine, and had just started a Borderlands 2 campaign with 3 other people (I was planning on, and had used for one session already, my PS camera), it seemed like fate.</p>

<p>I've now used this in three 3 to 4 hour sessions and I'm completely sold. Unlike Warhawk's headset this one features a very nice external speaker. This means that instead of resting inside my ear a bit, it sits completely outside of it, resting against the ear. This is by far the best feature of this headset. Maybe others include this, but since it's new to me, it's an eye-opener.</p>

<p>The piece that wraps around the ear is also fixed, which I initially thought was going to be an issue, but actually works rather well.</p>

<p>The mute button is easy to trigger, and emits a pleasant tone when it's activated. I'm not sure what I think about the volume buttons yet, since touching them seems a little off, but it's not a big issue.</p>

<p>I also had to turn up the volume of the microphone on my PlayStation 3 itself as it was mentioned I was a little quiet. However, I'm generally that way in real-life, so that's probably me, and not a big deal since it only had to be set once.</p>

<p>The inclusion of different headsets is rather nice, but I haven't felt the need to change the one it already had on. Overall, I'm completely sold with my almost 4 weeks of use, and would definitely recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ASOLLM?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">PlayStation 3 EX-02 Next Gen Bluetooth Headset</a> to anyone that needs one for the PlayStation 3. 5 of 5 stars.</p>
