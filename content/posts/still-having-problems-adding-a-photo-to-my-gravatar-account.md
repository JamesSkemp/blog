<p>
While I&#39;ve been able to create an account, and upload an image to that account, I can&#39;t seem to be able to associate that image with my Gravatar account.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat troubling, especially since support doesn&#39;t seem to want to get back to me ...
</p>
<p>
A couple of days ago I decided to sign up, but if this is what I can expect, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s a) free and b) that I&#39;ve turned it off for my site.
</p>
<h4>Update, August 3, 2007</h4>
<p>
Gravatar allowed me to add an image to my email address today. However, still no response from their support team on my original email.
</p>
<p>
As such, I won&#39;t be using it on my site(s) until this issue gets resolved.&nbsp;
