Congrats Apple - you&#39;ve gotten away with it. 
</p>
<p>
Media 2.0 has pulled out their banners, and is waving them proudly, all the while talking talking about how Safari 3.1 is now a part of Apple Update on Windows. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure what you&#39;re more excited about is that nobody is talking about ... the fact that the size of your updates is as large as the initial installer. 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s right, you&#39;ve gotten away with it. There are few companies out there that can say that they&#39;ve got an update, have it be the same as the installer, and actually have that fact ignored by the masses. 
</p>
<p>
Woohoo! 
</p>
<p>
As for the minor issue of Safari 3.1 getting pushed out? Tom Krazit has a good post over at CNET - <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13579_3-9900727-37.html" target="_blank">Think before you install</a> - but sadly the people that need it the most won&#39;t read it. 
</p>
<p>
Mozilla is just sore that they didn&#39;t have a product that they could piggy-back their browser onto, like Apple has Safari. 
</p>
<p>
Granted, the update to Safari should have been optional, unless you&#39;ve already got another version installed. But, <strong>how many times have you had to uncheck the Google Toolbar add-on</strong> when installing a piece of software?
