<h3>I'll be honest, I might be missing the point of these</h3>
<p>If, after reading my review's title, you haven't already decided to hit the 'No' button next to 'Was this review helpful to you' and otherwise ignore my review, thank you.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that I might not understand the point of these. As I understand it, the point is to peacefully color these mandalas in a relaxed environment. But as a generally relaxed person, there's no way one of these is going to take 30 minutes to complete, unless you're constantly being interrupted. And an environment like that is going to cancel out any benefit gained from this.</p>
<p>Honestly, there's just not that much coloring to do on any one page; one per page, instead of the larger quantities suggested by the cover.</p>
<p>But, that's me. This was a gift for my mom, that my sister recommended, and she seemed pleased to get it. However, I think they were both more impressed by the other coloring book that was purchased - Between the Lines: Volume 2.</p>
<p>3 stars since the individual this was purchased for seemed to enjoy it, but I don't see it providing too much relaxation.</p>
