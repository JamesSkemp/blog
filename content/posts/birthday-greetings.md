<p>
It&#39;s my birthday today. Originally, I had planned on writing about what today was like, as well as where I thought I&#39;d be in a year and in 10 years. However, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m rather under the weather, so that&#39;s all out.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
In fact, I had written just a couple of lines. Stamps increased in price from 39 cents to 41, and forever stamps came out a bit ago (I picked up a packet last week).
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s wildfires in California and Florida, and now in Georgia.
</p>
<p>
Gas is $3.199, and expected to reach over $4 this summer.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not the same order, but that&#39;s what I wrote. Then I deleted it all and started anew.
</p>
<p>
I had lunch today with two young ladies from work at Noodles; it was good.
</p>
<p>
I had dinner with my mom and sister at Famous Dave&#39;s; I had a very upset stomach, but it was good nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
I plan on purchasing a new lens for my camera this weekend with the $100 from my mom and the freelance money I earned last month (or maybe with my AdSense money? I don&#39;t know, maybe freelance paid for Pearl&#39;s cat tree ...).
</p>
<p>
My mom said she&#39;d buy my current camera if she could pay in installments, so it looks like I&#39;ll be upgrading ...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been saying I was going to get a new lens since at least last year, if not earlier - now, perhaps, I finally am.
</p>
<p>
I said today that I don&#39;t much celebrate birthdays, and it&#39;s true. It&#39;s like Lent (that&#39;s where you have to give something up, right?); I don&#39;t &#39;celebrate&#39; it, and haven&#39;t since I was in grade school, because I don&#39;t much see the point. You can plan ahead all you want, but that doesn&#39;t mean much. That&#39;s not to say that we shouldn&#39;t have goals, quite the contrary, but ... it shouldn&#39;t be just because it&#39;s a particular day.
</p>
<p>
Rather, celebrate each day, in effect. After all, does it really matter that today is my birthday? To everyone else, it&#39;s no different than most other Mondays.
</p>
<p>
You know what I&#39;d really like to have done in a year?
</p>
<p>
So in short, I&#39;m going to head to bed now, even though it&#39;s only 8. Of course, as usual, when I go to bed when I&#39;m not really tired (read: exhausted), I&#39;ll be reading until I am tired, or at least until I&#39;ve reached a good spot to stop. But, perhaps Pearl will head to bed as well, although she&#39;ll probably be keeping watch for that cat that keeps harassing her ...
</p>
<p>
No, I&#39;m not going to get drunk tonight, and yes, there&#39;s probably other things that I could be doing, but ... it doesn&#39;t matter. And, if I need to say it&#39;s because it&#39;s my birthday, because no other excuse will do, I won&#39;t get bent out of shape if that&#39;s what I have to say ...
</p>
