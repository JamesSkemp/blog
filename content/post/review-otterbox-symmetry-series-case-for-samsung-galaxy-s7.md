The following is a review of the OtterBox SYMMETRY SERIES Case for Samsung Galaxy S7, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## A cross between an OtterBox and a slim case

I've always preferred slimmer cases for my phones, so when I picked up a [Samsung Galaxy S7][galaxy-s7] a handful of months ago I ultimately decided upon the [tech21 EVO ELITE Protectective Case][tech21] for my device.

However, my girlfriend uses an OtterBox, specifically one of the DEFENDER SERIES cases for her Galaxy S6, and I recently picked up a bike, and we were going to be out biking, with our mobile devices in tow. So when I saw Amazon had OtterBox cases available for review I decided to try them out.

I've always preferred slimmer cases since they fit well in my pocket, along with my wallet, and in particular I've always associated OtterBox cases with being rather bulky.

However, the [OtterBox SYMMETRY SERIES Case for Samsung Galaxy S7][symmetry] is actually quite slim, knocking my preconceptions out of the water. I'd actually consider it to be only slightly thicker than my tech21 case, although made of a much solider plastic.

Part of this has to do with the fact that, unlike the [OtterBox DEFENDER SERIES][defender], the case consists only of a plastic wrapper around the device. This means that the screen is not covered, so you'll still need to purchase something else for that purpose.

It offers full access to all ports, with extra space around the headphone and power jacks. Each of the three buttons, power and both volume controls, is covered by plastic buttons built into the case, which I've had no issues using. The camera and flash on the back of the phone are completely open.

Since the top is open, the sides of the cases slips only slightly to the top of the phone, and has causes absolutely no issues with touch on the sides, no blocking of the display.

The plastic covering the phone is made of an interesting solid rubber. I haven't used it enough to determine if it will or not, but I think its construction will prevent any issues with the plastic starting to crack, as I've had with some cases in the past.

So after using this product I've actually come to an interesting conclusion, since I think it will be replacing my [tech21 EVO ELITE Protectective Case][tech21] for an extended period of time. Unlike other OtterBox cases, its slim, but still seemingly provides a similar level of protection for the back and sides of my phone. Five of five stars.
