<p>
When I think of Europe I think of the U.K., France, then Germany. What about Spain though?
</p>
<p>
Moving east, Japan and China, followed by North Korea. I realize that India should be on the list, but it&#39;s not one that immediately comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
Africa, as a whole, is not on the list; only bad things come to mind (AIDs and spammers/scammers).
