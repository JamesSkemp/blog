<p>This is no longer the current version. <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/LogParserPlus/">View information about the current version of Log Parser Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Log Parser is a command line-based utility useful to parse IIS logs and more.</p>
<p>While a number of applications exist to help use Log Parser, as well as a number of sites containing <a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/">Log Parser queries</a>, I haven't been very happy with them.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make it even easier to work with Log Parser, I present version 0.2.1 BETA of Log Parser Plus (not to be confused with the Web site, <a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/">LogParserPlus.com</a>).</p>
<p>Download <a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/LogParserPlus_0.2.1.zip">Log Parser Plus 0.2.1 BETA</a>.</p>
<p>Log Parser Plus 0.2.1 BETA is, as noted, currently under development. It lacks proper threading, and could use a number of user interface tweaks. Since I use IIS for personal and business purposes, I will be working towards version 1.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>Microsoft Log Parser is required, and can be <a rel="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07">downloaded from Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>Questions, comments, and concerns are appreciated.</p>
