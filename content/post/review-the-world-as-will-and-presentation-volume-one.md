The following book review is for the Richard E.&nbsp;Aquila translation of Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321355784?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321355784" target="_blank">The World as Will and Presentation, Volume One</a>.

<p>
A brief history of my previous experiences with Schopenhauer: I first read Schopenhauer&#39;s The World as Will and Representation (the Payne, definitive, translation) many years ago. I&#39;ve also read a number of Schopenhauer&#39;s other works (mostly done by Payne) and have tried to pick up as many other works of his as I can. 
</p>
<p>
For the most part, I find that Schopenhauer&#39;s philosophy most closely matched/matches my own. 
</p>
<p>
That said, I saw and picked up this translation with a bit of hesitation. The World as Will and *Presentation*? Why go beyond Payne&#39;s standard translation? 
</p>
<p>
However, as I read the translator&#39;s introduction, I saw that my fears were unnecessary. Aquila (and probably Carus, once Volume 2 finally comes out and we can read it) have given us a truly remarkable book. 
</p>
<p>
Aquila not only knows that Payne&#39;s translations are the standards, he doesn&#39;t seem to desire to change that. Instead, Aquila has presented us with a new translation, geared towards those new to Schopenhauer. In this sense, while Payne may remain the standard, definitive, translation, I see these new translations becoming the classroom standard.
