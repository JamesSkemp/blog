<h3>Runs hot, but nice interface and speeds</h3>

<p>I have a couple routers around the house, but I've always been a fan of Linksys, so when I saw the opportunity to review the Linksys AC1200+ I snapped it up. Unfortunately, while it has a number of good points, I'll ultimately be unplugging it and using an existing device instead.</p>

<p>First, the good. The setup (ignoring the Smart Wi-Fi application for a moment) was pretty painless. Once the router came back up I was able to connect to both bands of the device without issue.</p>

<p>Compared to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V00K3W?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">D-Link</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044YU60M?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Medialink</a> router, as well as past Linksys models (WRT54G/L), I actually rather liked the web interface that they provided. The single light on the top of the device isn't ultra-bright, so I didn't have to keep the light in mind for placement. Speeds and signal strength seemed comparable to my other routers, which is to say perfectly sufficient.</p>

<p>Going back to the Smart Wi-Fi functionality, I ultimately have no need for such an application, but it was easy enough to skip during the setup. It also has functionality to check for updates automatically, but since I don't trust devices not to brick themselves during an auto-update, I opted to turn this off.</p>

<p>Now, the bad. This thing runs extremely hot. Within a few minutes. That combined with the size of the box requires a certain amount of planning on where the device can be placed. Having a number of other devices, this is by far the hottest one I have. And yes, I mean hot, not warm.</p>

<p>So is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JZWQW4C?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Linksys AC1200 Wi-Fi Wireless Dual-Band+ Router with Gigabit &amp; USB Ports (EA6350)</a> worth the more than $100 it's currently selling at? I'm not sure. My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009V00K3W?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">D-Link dual-band router (DIR-855L)</a> has served me extremely well, with a smaller footprint and heat signature. I really like the interface, but realistically I'll use it about once a year or so.</p>

<p>So ultimately I'd say it's four of five stars. If you're okay with the price, it does what it says it's going to do, but you'll need to make room for the device. If you're not okay with the price, then you can find alternatives without compromising.</p>
