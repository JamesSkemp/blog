<p>From the archives, I've created an <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xsd/2010/09/03/OnimushaDawnOfDreams.xsd">XML Schema</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xml/OnimushaDawnOfDreams.xml">XML data file for Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams</a>, for the Playstation 2. Currently the data only includes armor leveling information, from level 1 to 100.</p>
<p>The data comes from an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (OnimushaDawnofDreams.ods) from way back in May of 2006.</p>
<p>My characters and core weapons being completely maxed (not to mention souls), I may decide to replay the game to track this information as well, or just upgrade weapons.</p>
