  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of To the Moon (2011), available for PC on Steam. Good story, but iffy controls From the reviews of this game I was expecting a short game with a good story. And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.</div>

  <div class="body">The following is a review of Hexcells Plus (2014), played on the PC. More of the same, with a bit more complexity Having gone through the first Hexcells rather quickly, I just as quickly started playing the standalone Hexcells Plus. While this game contains the same number of puzzles as the original, it adds additional gameplay dynamics. While I finished the first in less than 2 hours, Steam reports that I put in 8 hours on this version.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of Hexcells (2014), played on the PC. A short, but enjoyable, puzzle game Ultimately, I recommend Hexcells, especially for the price I paid ($1.25 with the standalone expansion), as I got a around 110 minutes of play. It's a pretty basic puzzle game, with some extra dynamics added in as you progress. I do wish that the puzzles were a little more complex, but I also tend to enjoy this type of game, so the general idea wasn't new to me.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of Radiant Historia (2011), released for the Nintendo DS. Fantastic music and interesting branching story When I ordered Radiant Historia back in February 2013 I'll readily admit that I played for only a few hours before I let it, and my 3DS, sit and gather dust. At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (2013), played on the PC. An enjoyable hack and slash dungeon crawler Having recently built a gaming PC I had to think hard about what game(s) I would initially pick up. Since Diablo II was such an enjoyable game, and one of my most memorable experiences when I was PC gaming, I initially looked at Diablo III. However, the current state of the game, and knowing that eventually the DLC and base game would be selling for half the price, led me to look elsewhere.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of Ghost Trick, released in 2011, for the Nintendo DS. What a very good game A very short while ago I watched a video that featured Ghost Trick briefly, and I fell in love with the graphic style of the game. After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">The following is a review of Contrast, released in 2013, for the PlayStation 4. Charming Since Watch Dogs was delayed, I've been thinking about what game would be my first PlayStation 4 experience. Between Contrast, Flower, and Resogun, I ultimately decided upon Contrast, since while I had played flOw first on my PlayStation 3, I had already played (and enjoyed) Flower on the PS3, and wanted something slightly different. Contrast is free for PlayStation Plus subscribers, of which I am one of.</div>

  <div class="body">The following is a review of Alice: Madness Returns, released in 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A dark masterpiece I picked up a new copy of Alice: Madness Returns for the Xbox 360 back in April of 2012. Since it came with a copy of the original American Mcgee&rsquo;s Alice, I decided to start with that in May. However, it took me until November of that year to beat that game (it was good, just long), and then I didn&rsquo;t start the main game until the middle of August.</div>

  </header>
  <div class="body">Last month I was playing Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention on the PlayStation Vita. I had finished the game, but had started a new game and was picking up the Diez Gentleman by losing to Raspberyl. Unfortunately, when I lost to her I kept getting the error code of C2-12828-1, and the game crashed. In my particular case I just didn't have enough room in homeroom. Unfortunately I forget the exact number, but the game wants you to keep more slots open than you need.</div>

  <div class="body">This morning I created two API wrappers for the Mashape implementations of XboxApi.com and XboxLeaders.com. These unofficial APIs allow you to pull information from Xbox Live for particular users. I've used a simiilar structure for both (based upon XboxLeaders.com's PHP wrapper, since I thought I was working against there API when I was in fact working against XboxApi.com's ...), and both are available on Github. XboxLeadersWrapper XboxApiWrapper In order to use these APIs you'll need to have an account on Mashape, subscribe, and generate keys.</div>
