<p>
Over the past couple of days I&#39;ve noticed issues with the Inbox view of Gmail being extremely slow on Firefox (2.0.0.5, the current version).
</p>
<p>
Disabling JavaScript makes the load much faster (naturally), but even switching to Internet Explorer (7) works (with JS on).
</p>
<p>
With Firefox 2.0.0.5 already having a security issue, I wonder if updating was a good decision in this case. Perhaps 2.0.0.5 was released a bit too quickly?&nbsp;
