<p>This afternoon I picked up a <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TLU67W/?tag=strivinglifen-20">PlayStation 2 slim model</a> from Best Buy. I've already got a fat PS2, from way back in 2004 (after a bit of research, it looks like January, and that I paid about $200 for it), that still works pretty darn good, although the controllers are a bit ... discouraging.</p>
<p>My PlayStation 3 is also backwards compatible, so between the two I should be able to play my 52 PlayStation 2 (plus those I purchase in the future, as purchase I will)&nbsp;games for many years into the future.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason a couple of months ago I promised myself that when I next received a check from Google I'd use that $100 to purchase a new PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>The PS2 continues to sell extremely well, despite being a last generation system. In fact, Amazon currently has it listed as number 140 in their <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/videogames/ref=pd_dp_ts_vg_1?tag=strivinglifen-20">list of bestselling video games</a>. The original Xbox that I found on Amazon was listed as number 899, with used or collectible options, both starting under $100. The Gamecube is available for under $70 (new) and is listed as number 779.</p>
<p>As of right now, the PS2 has sold, worldwide, the most number of units, with the Nintendo DS about 2.5 million units away, according to <a rel="external" href="http://www.vgchartz.com/hardware_totals.php">VGChartz</a>&nbsp;(and with new versions coming out, still under the DS name, it'll certainly gain the number 1 spot). (The top half of the chart is all Sony and Nintendo products, interestingly.)</p>
<p>I was shocked that PS2s were still selling a number of months ago, but now, after purchasing a slim (which is <em>amazingly</em> small and light), it doesn't seem that shocking.</p>
<p>Having played it for a couple of hours, it somewhat reminds me of when I picked up my <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Retro-Twin-Video-System-Nintendo-DS/dp/B001VDZN3O/?tag=strivinglifen-20">Retro Duo</a>, so I could play Earthbound and the other SNES titles I enjoyed. There's just something about playing games for the really great systems ...</p>
