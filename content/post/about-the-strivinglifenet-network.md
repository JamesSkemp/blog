<p>
First, let&#39;s talk about the StrivingLife.net network.
</p>
<p>
To do that, we&#39;ll have to talk about how I got to this point.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
Way back in &#39;97 or so, I started creating Web pages that I published for public consumption.  They were rudimentary, at best.
</p>
<p>
My first pages were under an AOL member account, under the username of jrogue14.  I don&#39;t have any editions of that old content.
</p>
<p>
The next pages I remember were at Tripod.  I dabbled in a number of other free hosts as well, but Tripod is what I most remember, and where I stayed.  jamesrskemp.tripod.com became, in December 2002, an actual domain - jamesrskemp.net<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
JamesRSkemp.net had a number of different versions, but I wasn&#39;t quite happy with the direction it was going in.  JamesRSkemp.net was very personal and specific.  When I offered to host the articles of a fellow student, Gavin Schmitt, there was a real problem with hosting his files under my name.  While jamesrskemp.net/gavin was used, it was still &#39;me&#39; that was being focused on.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, I began planning a new domain.  I decided I would keep the old domain, and all it&#39;s content, but create something that would hopefully appeal to a larger audience.  After a good deal of thought, I finally decided upon StrivingLife.net, and, in September of 2004, StrivingLife.net became a reality.
</p>
<p>
A brief aside about StrivingLife.net.  According to Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th Century German philosopher, the &#39;world&#39;, in the largest sense of the word, is will.  And the will is constantly striving.  That&#39;s all you need to know about why I picked StrivingLife.  The .net was easy enough - I wanted StrivingLife.net to become a network for ideas.
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s been less than a year since StrivingLife.net was created, the number of sites related to it has grown.
</p>
<p>
If we remember back a few paragraphs ago, there was jamesrskemp.net and jamesrskemp.net/gavin  While I kept jamesrskemp.net, I began converting the old files into a new format for StrivingLife.net.  This new format consisted of PDF files created from Word documents.  Since the previous pages were in HTML, this resulted in some amount of work.  However, I was able to gain structure, and the ability to allow people to print documents in a standard, and non-coloured, format.  See, the old HTML pages were quite the colour beasts.
</p>
<p>
Gavin&#39;s site, after a little bit of discussion and thought, became FramingBusiness.net, in February 2005.
</p>
<p>
While I stopped maintaing JamesRSkemp.net after getting StrivingLife.net, redirecting old files to the new when I could, and while FramingBusiness.net was Gavin&#39;s content, I was still doing all of the layout work for the latter site.  So, I was creating an even larger project than originally attended.
</p>
<p>
Anywho, therein lies the beginnings of the StrivingLife.net network.  In June of 2005, I added two more sites to the fold, but sans content.   ClownsStealSouls.net and StopStriving.net were based on ideas, but I&#39;ve yet to find the time to expand upon them.
</p>
<p>
In August of 2005 I was able to create DoNotDenyMyUnicorn.com, this time having content to post.  Originally intended to be a joint production, it appears that upkeep is solely up to me now, and with no way for anyone to contact me (without doing a whois, that is), it appears I need to either continue producing it by myself, or add some contact information.
</p>
<p>
And that&#39;s the StrivingLife.net network.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be talking about site specifics, like how I get these sites online, how popular they are, and what I&#39;m using to create these pages, among other things.
