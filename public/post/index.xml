&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the Kindle version of Brian Ruh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1UVnQcW&#34;&gt;Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii&lt;/a&gt; (Second Edition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-interesting-look-at-mamoru-oshii-s-works:e87d36541fad6943ce217f3a725ac75f&#34;&gt;An interesting look at Mamoru Oshii&amp;rsquo;s works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many others, my first introduction to Mamoru Oshii was via &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1TcTFhx&#34;&gt;the first Ghost in the Shell movie&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I was looking for something like the Matrix, and the Internet of the time highly recommended looking at Ghost in the Shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go on later to watch and enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1UVoreC&#34;&gt;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&lt;/a&gt;, another of Oshii&amp;rsquo;s works, and then in 2006 I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1q9TesV&#34;&gt;Urusei Yatsura Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly thanks to a forum post recommending it as being similar to the movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://wakinglifemovie.net/&#34;&gt;Waking Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007 I would watch the animated &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1VPdtIo&#34;&gt;Blood: The Last Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and then in 2010, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1XWLAg9&#34;&gt;Avalon&lt;/a&gt;. It was the use of the dog in the film that made me think of Innocence, and then to discovering that Mamoru Oshii had a part in all of these movies. So in 2014 when I saw a used copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/22FH0ti&#34;&gt;Mamoru Oshii: Cinema Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, I immediately picked it up, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/22FHdgd&#34;&gt;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1Ryd0HF&#34;&gt;the first Patlabor film&lt;/a&gt; being additional recent purchases this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this because I came into Brian Ruh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1UVnQcW&#34;&gt;Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii&lt;/a&gt; with some level of experience with Mamoru Oshii&amp;rsquo;s works, and is definitely a creator (being much more than just a director) that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of and watch out for. So with Brian Ruh&amp;rsquo;s book I was hoping to get a better idea of just who Mamoru Oshii is, and for new insights into his various works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I must comment on the Kindle version of the book. This version appeared to be the easiest (and possibly only) way to get a copy of the Second Edition, which includes three additional chapters, including most importantly one on Innocence. Sadly, the Kindle version of the book (read on a Kindle Fire 7, in mid-March 2016) appears to have issues with some special characters. For instance, the Yen symbol, as well as oddly placed dashes and underscores, are mingled within Japanese names. This was slightly distracting, and is something I would hope would be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, this book covers Oshii&amp;rsquo;s major films, including a brief synopsis of the piece, characters of note, commentary, and analysis. With the book setup to cover a major work, or universe, in chronological order, you can truly see the transition and growth of Mamoru Oshii. Since I have not seen all of the works covered, of special note were the synopsis pieces, as Brian Ruh does quite a good job of retelling the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one thing that I would have hoped for was more on Mamoru Oshii&amp;rsquo;s The Red Spectacles, Stray Dog, and Talking Head. While mentioned briefly, they are some of the more cryptic works of Oshii&amp;rsquo;s, although that difficulty and obscurity may in fact be why Brian Ruh didn&amp;rsquo;t devote a chapter to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, the exclusion of an in-depth look at these works does not sufficiently detract from the works that are covered, and the level at which they are. The Second Edition of Brian Ruh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1UVnQcW&#34;&gt;Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii&lt;/a&gt; is definitely a good overview of Mamoru Oshii, and comes recommended with a full five of five stars. If some of the ideas brought up by the first two Ghost in the Shell movies are of interest to you, or you&amp;rsquo;ve seen more than a couple of his films, then you too may enjoy this book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Amazon Fire 7 (2015 release) Case</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Amazon-Fire-7-2015-release-Case/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/21Crdpw&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire 7&amp;rdquo; (2015 release) Case - Slim Lightweight Standing Custom Fit Cover for Amazon Fire 7 Inch Tablet&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-as-good-a-fit-but-still-nigh-perfect:1e6bdfef9507fbe30ae96a8f4c7afa87&#34;&gt;Not as good a fit, but still nigh perfect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right around Christmas I was out shopping around for a replacement to my second generation Nexus 7, due to speed and battery issues. Within a couple days I had picked up one of the 2015 models of the Amazon Fire 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month later I received a &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1KASRLG&#34;&gt;Verso Fire 7 2015 Case&lt;/a&gt; for it, and while I tried it out, the material of the case, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s hinge and ribbon to keep it closed, were things that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too happy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, around the same time I had the chance to try out one of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s cases for their Fire HD 8, and I loved it. Since it&amp;rsquo;s effectively the same thing in a smaller package, I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat some of what I said in my review of that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first nice thing about the case is that it leaves all of the buttons free. While a case with button covers doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean the buttons require more pressure to be used, having them clear is so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case also features a pretty powerful magnet, which combined with the case wraps around the device, means that the cover stays in place, but can still be removed with relative ease. It also sticks quite well to the back of the case, which means that it has the same profile open or closed, with no slippage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought the oddest thing about these cases was that the cover folds in half diagonally. Within the box itself is the two ways this fold can be used to stand it up either in portrait or landscape view, but after three plus weeks, I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten used to this, and had to play around with the flap a bit before I got it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried the smaller model I&amp;rsquo;m quite used to it, and it basically feels natural. However, I do have a little trouble keeping my 8&amp;rsquo;s cover in place on some smooth surfaces. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is because of usage, or if it&amp;rsquo;s because of the texture of the surface I&amp;rsquo;m setting it on. Time will tell if this is an issue with these cases in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case feels pretty ridge, but still has some flex to it. It fits fairly snug around the tablet itself, but leaves enough of the device free for it be relatively flat on the top of the tablet itself. With the larger case this initially lead me to believe that it might pop out of the case, but thus far still have had no issues with it. However, with the case for the Fire 7 I have noticed that the Fire will very occasionally pop out a bit. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively minor, but I&amp;rsquo;m keeping my eye on whether the case is ever so slightly smaller than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, much like the Fire HD 8 case, I have to give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/21Crdpw&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire 7&amp;rdquo; (2015 release) Case - Slim Lightweight Standing Custom Fit Cover for Amazon Fire 7 Inch Tablet&lt;/a&gt; a full five of five stars. The case itself is pricey, especially compared with the AmazonBasics line, which I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with, but the case quality is high, and works very well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK Desktop Console (Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD) NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1L3RU4m&#34;&gt;Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK Desktop Console, featuring an Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-weird-hybrid:1c33e12b551c6ddfc11283fe6f1c9dff&#34;&gt;A weird hybrid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I&amp;rsquo;ve got to say I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to review the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK. Do I compare it to the consoles, as that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;re trying to make (especially with SteamOS being the OS on this machine)? Or do I compare it to a Desktop computer, since the games you play are those you&amp;rsquo;d typically play on a PC? Or is it something new, like tablets were many years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to think of it as a hybrid between the two, so that&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ll review it, for better or worse. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be focusing solely on the SteamOS version of this system. Since that&amp;rsquo;s how they sell it, that&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m going to review it. If you want to know how it performs with Windows, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we compare it to a console. With the processing power being what it is, and the ability to upgrade some components of it, I consider the system to be on-par with a current gen console, which to me means the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the operating system, I put SteamOS somewhere between the PS4 and Xbone. The PS4 has, what I consider, to be a great interface. Not as good as the PS3&amp;rsquo;s, but good nonetheless. The Xbone&amp;rsquo;s interface is nowhere near as good as the 360&amp;rsquo;s interface was, and isn&amp;rsquo;t even as easy as the Windows 8.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; interface it tries to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SteamOS&amp;rsquo;s interface shares some similarities with the standard desktop interface, but does have a learning curve. This is especially noticeable when you use the Stream controller, as the d-pad must be used to navigate, as opposed to the d-pad or left stick. It baffles me that they&amp;rsquo;d do this. There&amp;rsquo;s also the issue of being unable to access pieces of the interface you see, such as being able to press up to get into the downloads/settings area, even though you see them, unless you back out far enough. Either don&amp;rsquo;t show components I can&amp;rsquo;t access, or show them differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games are definitely at the center of the SteamOS interface, much like on the PS4 (and not so much on the Xbone), but given the nature of the library being shared between all your PCs, the library, by default, contains all games you own, not just those that you can install and play on the console. The library can be filtered, but as far as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this has to be done every single time. The games you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded do display in a different area, so there&amp;rsquo;s at least that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we have the controller itself, which the console (noted as &amp;lsquo;Console Only&amp;rsquo; on Amazon) does include. It&amp;rsquo;s, quite frankly, pretty dang cool. It&amp;rsquo;s effectively a reversed Xbox 360/One controller, but with only one actual stick. However, the pads work pretty dang good. However, the button placement, especially of the Start, Back, and bumpers, are still taking me a while to get used to. The face buttons too, mess me up for a little bit, as they&amp;rsquo;re placed in a location contrary to the PS and Xbox controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a couple long sessions, I can honestly say I never noticed the controller in my hand, like I would with the Xbox 360/One, and to a lesser extent, the various PlayStation controllers. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s the balance, or the way the grips are bent, or something else, but it just feels good. Heck, it might even be the placement of the face buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played one game with the controller mapping to a keyboard (I actually had to create a custom controller mapping for the game), and for the simple tasks I needed to do, it worked quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at it from the console perspective, how about from a desktop? Since it&amp;rsquo;s running a version of Linux behind the curtain, Windows-only games aren&amp;rsquo;t going to run. However, some have had luck running non-SteamOS games, that would normally run on Linux, on this console. I was tempted to try this out with a couple GOG games, but after reading through the forum posts on it, decided it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth a try yet (although might be if GOG releases a Linux client for their interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to try out the SteamOS, and not purchase a Windows license, about a quarter of the games I own on Steam could run on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1L3RU4m&#34;&gt;Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK&lt;/a&gt;. This included some high-end games (BioShock Infinite, Pillars of Eternity) and mid-range games (City Skylines), but also a lot of lower end, or indie, games. Sadly, for me this meant that while I tried to go SteamOS-only, I ended up back on my main machine more than I would have liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is probably developer support, and having seen it first-hand, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the future of the SteamOS is. If Steam puts a lot of weight behind it, then it might do well. If developers don&amp;rsquo;t keep releasing their games for SteamOS/Linux, then &amp;hellip; at least you can install Windows on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So compared to a console, it&amp;rsquo;s probably on par, more if you don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be able to play every Steam game on it, and less the smaller the percentage of games in your library that will run on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to a typical Windows machine running Steam, it&amp;rsquo;s a lesser experience, assuming SteamOS is left on the machine. The controller is nice, but you could save yourself some money and just purchase the controller by itself. Or just get the standard which is a wired Xbox 360 controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last note to make before my closing is that my machine restarted way more than I would have expected. It seemed to have been increased after installing the beta updates, but even before I was running into random restarts when navigating around the interface. Thankfully the system didn&amp;rsquo;t restart when I was playing any games, but it worries me when I&amp;rsquo;m just navigating around the interface and the machine just goes black and restarts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had one game which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t download (0 bytes downloaded of 0 bytes). I tried numerous things to debug this, but it seems to strike some users with some games. Download speeds also seemed a little slower than usual, but I attribute this more to the Steam network, as I very rarely get the maximum speeds from even the Windows client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all that said &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to rate the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1L3RU4m&#34;&gt;Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK Desktop Console&lt;/a&gt;. If you come into it expecting something on par with a Windows gaming PC, you&amp;rsquo;ll be sorely disappointed. But if you come into it as someone wanting to get a taste of what PC gaming is like, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have a big catalog of games, this might not be a bad way to get started. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to find a SteamOS game that doesn&amp;rsquo;t also run on Windows, so you&amp;rsquo;d be free to upgrade (and upgrade is what it would be) to a real gaming PC down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone with a big catalog of games, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid middle of the road for me; 3 of 5 stars. As a console, it&amp;rsquo;s 4 stars. As a gaming PC running SteamOS, it&amp;rsquo;s 3 stars. If this were the Windows version, the latter would probably (considering all else) jump to 4 stars. But would the console aspect suffer? That I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: ZAGG Slim Cover, Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Tablet Keyboard for Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and 4 (MC3WKK-BB0)</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/review-zagg-slim-cover-surface-4-mc3wkk-bb0/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 20:17:34 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/review-zagg-slim-cover-surface-4-mc3wkk-bb0/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1TxgNYG&#34;&gt;ZAGG Slim Cover, Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Tablet Keyboard for Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and 4 (MC3WKK-BB0)&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;actually-on-par-with-the-official-type-cover:0d9adfc3adb2cd2b0aef31302877af51&#34;&gt;Actually on par with the official type cover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1WzBRfc&#34;&gt;Surface Pro 4&lt;/a&gt; a number of months ago I opted to spend the extra money to get the official type cover with it. Having used a couple other two-in-one machines, getting used to the keys wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the ZAGG Slim Cover up for review I jumped on it, as I wondered if they could do better. Having used it for a couple weeks now, I can honestly say the ZAGG Slim Cover is on par with the official covers, with some things being better, and some not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have the packaging. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to take this out of the packaging. Slice the tape, slip the bag with it out, and then then connect it to your Surface with Bluetooth. A USB cable to charge the keyboard (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the Surface for power) is also included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the device is about the same thickness as my Surface Pro 4. This is a bit of downside, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1Txh1Pe&#34;&gt;the official type cover&lt;/a&gt; is really thin. Because of the size and weight it also doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily feel like it&amp;rsquo;s going to stay covering the Surface like the official one does. I didn&amp;rsquo;t run into any issues with this, but I put my Surface in an Amazon Basics case when I put it into my bag, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t too many chances to test this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plus side of the depth of the keyboard is that the keys actually feel fairly normal. Not like a desktop keyboard, but closer to a traditional laptop. I also assume that the battery is another reason for the size. The only issue I had with the keys was a broken left arrow/Home key. The top of the key wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay seated in the device. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the type cover this keyboard does have backlit keys, however they&amp;rsquo;re either on or off, unlike the type cover&amp;rsquo;s range of brightness. Having used the type cover&amp;rsquo;s variable brightness this is actually a bit of a disappointment. Had the ZAGG keyboard been my first, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have cared as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we have the battery. Surprisingly, I have yet to need to charge the battery on the device, although I did bounce between the two covers for all but the last week and a half. I also tend to use my Surface for some work meetings, and between 10 minutes to a couple hours after work / on the weekend. So, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve put 40 hours of use into it over the last 3+ weeks, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely more than a couple days. So while I thought having to charge the device would be an issue, it actually seems pretty efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we have how it connects to the Surface. This is actually the biggest downside, as if you connect it like you would the official type cover you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the taskbar is covered up slightly. At first this actually bothered me, but then I started disconnecting the keyboard from the Surface, and/or keeping it flat. The portability, especially when I was in bed at night, is something I&amp;rsquo;d miss if I had to go back to just my type cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth, this also means it can be used with other devices, with the ability to pair and bounce between two. I didn&amp;rsquo;t test this too much, but it worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few minor points. I rarely used the trackpad on the device. Clicking felt odd to me, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because of how little I use it (I&amp;rsquo;ve used an external mouse since I got my Surface, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t switch back). For the very occasional mouse usage it worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is still taking a while for me to get used to is the function keys. F1-F12 serve two purposes, with the default being the special functions. For example, F1 pairs with Bluetooth device 1, F2 with device 2, F5 pulls up settings, and F12 turns up the volume. As a web developer I use F5 and F12 a lot. And I keep screwing up and neglect to push the Fn key when I use these! F2 is another I mess up, but seemingly everytime I try to use it to rename a file. However, given that I rarely do this, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly muscle memory to blame. It would have been nice if the default was the function keys, much like how the Delete key acts as the power button if you hold down the Fn key while using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that I had a loose key, and used a replacement keyboard. I ended up contacting ZAGG support to see if they could assist me with the Home key issue. I was hoping they might be able to send a replacement key that I could swap in. I emailed in on a Saturday, around 11:30 a.m., stating the issue (leaving out that I was reviewing the product for Amazon), and received a response around four hours later. On Tuesday they had sent out a package with a replacement, which I thought was just going to be a key, but when I got it Friday (3-day shipping) it was a new keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have to contact them because I didn&amp;rsquo;t receive information on shipping the old product back, but (again on a Saturday) I received a response that I&amp;rsquo;d be getting an email with the necessary UPS shipping label. I still have to go through the rest of that process, and will update this review once the warranty is taken care of completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think the ZAGG keyboard was going to be able to match what Microsoft did in the type cover. But while the type cover has some advantages (backlit key variability, size, power via the Surface), the ZAGG keyboard wins out in other cases (portability, keys, ability to use with other devices). Knowing what I know now, I think I might actually recommend that people take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1TxgNYG&#34;&gt;ZAGG Slim Cover, Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Tablet Keyboard for Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and 4 (MC3WKK-BB0)&lt;/a&gt; when picking up a Surface Pro 4 (or 3), instead of just going with the Microsoft type cover. For effectively matching the type cover, I give the ZAGG Slim Cover a full five of five stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Belatedly, I received the UPS mailing label and was able to get the keyboard with the faulty left arrow shipped off without issue. I had no issue with them receiving it, and have had no issues with my replacement keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1QcXE7G&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 471G Headset with Inline Mic and 3 Button Control&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;high-build-quality-and-terrific-sound:86eff25c7b82a356b95ce46fde09bb58&#34;&gt;High build quality, and terrific sound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably a decade ago I had a coworker who lent me a pair of her Sennheiser headphones for a couple hours one day. I was looking at picking up some nicer headphones, and she thought that listening to her&amp;rsquo;s might sway me, I think. While they certainly sounded good, I&amp;rsquo;m not much of an audiophile, so for me, compared to cheap headphones the difference in quality just wasn&amp;rsquo;t that different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m getting older, but after trying out the Sennheiser HD 471G headphones I&amp;rsquo;m a convert. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first talk about what comes in the box. We have the headphones themselves with a standard plug, as well as a 6.3 mm adapter. However, it also includes a second, longer cable, with the ability to swap them out. It also includes a nice bag to put the headphones in, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up using. It&amp;rsquo;s soft, instead of a hard case, so you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to keep them protected in bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphones feel pretty dang good, with a nice balance between being light, but not feeling cheap. On the head they also feel quite nice. The thickness of the top portion did take me a little while to get used to, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal. Otherwise I generally didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice these were on, save when the top bumped up against something when I rested my head back. Super comfortable, with no risk of slipping off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve got the sound quality. I used these with a Nexus 7, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1TY1Fmi&#34;&gt;Kindle Fire HD 8&lt;/a&gt;, an Asus Transformer Book, and a Surface Pro 4. Quality across all of them was great, with a mix of Google Play music, YouTube videos, Netflix, and hours of a series on Funimation. I tried a wide range of sound, from both quiet talking to louder shows/movies, and was quite impressed by the sound, with no distortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, as someone who had looked at Sennheiser in the past, but not been impressed after a short time with them, I can honestly say that I might have just needed to do so in order to get an idea of how good they actually sound. If you&amp;rsquo;re already looking at these, I&amp;rsquo;d say they&amp;rsquo;re worth it. They sound great, and they seem to have a good build quality. If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence about whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth dropping so much on a set of headphones, if you see yourself wearing them a couple hours a day, or every other day, it might actually be worth giving these a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1QcXE7G&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 471G Headset&lt;/a&gt; a full 5 of 5 stars. For better or worse, I think my time with them made me a convert.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Amazon Fire HD 8 (2015 release) Case</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Amazon-Fire-HD-8-2015-release-Case/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 19:50:52 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Amazon-Fire-HD-8-2015-release-Case/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1S7nlgy&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire HD 8 (2015 release) Case - Slim Lightweight Standing Custom Fit Cover with Auto Wake/Sleep for Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nigh Perfect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was looking at tablets since my second generation Nexus 7 is starting to get rather slow, and doesn&#39;t seem to want to hold a charge as well as it once did. After taking a look at a handful of devices I decided to pick up a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1S7oIvx&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when you buy a new tablet you have to buy a case for it, so I was glad to see Amazon&#39;s case up for review on Amazon Vine. While I had initially looked at the case when I was purchasing an SD card for the tablet, I was a little turned away by the price. In fact, I was definitely turned away by the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, having now used the case for over three weeks I can honestly say this is one of the best cases I&#39;ve had on a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first nice thing about the case is that it leaves all of the buttons free. While a case with button covers doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the buttons require more pressure to be used, having them clear is so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case also features a pretty powerful magnet, which combined with the case wraps around the device, means that the cover stays in place, but can still be removed with relative ease. It also sticks quite well to the back of the case, which means that it has the same profile open or closed, with no slippage. Do note that since the case can switch the power off automatically, once you put it into place initially you will have to switch it back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oddest thing about the case is that the cover folds in half diagonally. Within the box itself is the two ways this fold can be used to stand it up either in portrait or landscape view. Honestly, I still haven&#39;t gotten used to this, and have to play around with the flap a bit before I get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case feels pretty ridge, but still has some flex to it. It fits fairly snug around the tablet itself, but leaves enough of the device free for it be relatively flat on the top of the tablet itself. This initially lead me to believe that it might pop out of the case, but thus far have had no issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only minor complaint I have with this case is the fold to get the tablet standing up. However, since I do keep it mostly open, this is probably more due to lack of use. For this reason, I have to give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1S7nlgy&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire HD 8 (2015 release) Case - Slim Lightweight Standing Custom Fit Cover with Auto Wake/Sleep for Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet&lt;/a&gt; a full five of five stars. The case itself is pricey, especially compared with the AmazonBasics line, which I&#39;m most familiar with, but the case quality is high, and works very well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Verso-Fire-7-2015-Case-Sea-Blue-Classic-Slim-Fit-Premium-PU-Leather-Book-Folio-Style-Protective-Case-7-inch-Display-5th-Generation-2015-Release-Only/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1KASRLG&#34;&gt;Verso Fire 7 2015 Case - Sea Blue Classic Slim Fit Premium PU Leather Book Folio Style Protective Case (7 inch Display - 5th Generation, 2015 Release Only)&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If only the hinge were better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was looking at tablets since my second generation Nexus 7 is starting to get rather slow, and doesn&#39;t seem to want to hold a charge as well as it once did. After taking a look at a handful of devices I decided to pick up a new Amazon Fire 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, over the course of the next couple days the price of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1KAT6q4&#34;&gt;Amazon Fire 7&lt;/a&gt; kept nagging at me, and since I&#39;m a developer, and had some interest in developing for the Amazon Appstore, decided that I could splurge and get myself an early Christmas gift. Of course, that also meant that I needed to get a new case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I immediately noticed was the material the case was made with, and the second was the smell. While I&#39;ve since forgotten the smell, it lingered for the first handful of days, but was gone within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The texture of the materials is still about, but hard to explain. It&#39;s smooth, but it has something that gives it a very slight texture. It&#39;s hard to explain, and is better than the inside texture, which is much more noticeable. I&#39;m not sure what it is, but if I rub my thumbs back and forth on it the sound and texture causes &#39;tingles&#39; in my upper back/neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we have the hinge, which based upon my review title, is the key sticking point for me. Unlike many other cases the back doesn&#39;t stay attached to the back of the case, but instead about two thirds fold away and are used for the stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nice in principle, I instead found that if I wanted to hold the device as I would with a book, that the flexibility of the back and hinge caused the hinge to either fold oddly, or the top and most of the bottom to be too loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other feature of the note are the buttons on the top of the case that cover both volume buttons and the power. While the volume buttons seem fine, with little more pressure required, the power button does require more pressure to switch on/off. The impact of this is fairly minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case itself fits snugly around the Fire 7, and the top cover can be held in place, covering the screen, with the attached band. In practice I found that putting one edge of the band in place was sufficient most of the time. It seems sturdy enough, but time will tell how long it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the hinge is the biggest issue I have with this cover. For the 7-inch tablet I feel like my use case is as reading device, which means I ran into the hinge either buckling or sliding down far too often. Because of this I knock a star off and give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1KASRLG&#34;&gt;Verso Fire 7 2015&lt;/a&gt; Case 4 of 5 stars.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Fury of Dracula Third Edition Board Game</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Fury-of-Dracula-Third-Edition-Board-Game/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2016 09:24:03 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Fury-of-Dracula-Third-Edition-Board-Game/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1OkfQMt&#34;&gt;Fury of Dracula Third Edition Board Game&lt;/a&gt;, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So many pieces, but easy after a week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t played any of the previous editions of Fury of Dracula, so I can&#39;t speak to the changes made in this third edition. However, as I understand it, the game has changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This supports 2 to 5 players, with one player controlling Dracula and the others controlling one or more of the hunters. This does mean that in a two player game one person is controlling all four hunters, which is how I played it for the purposes of this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has an approximate run time of 2 to 3 hours, which is why I&#39;m reviewing it from a 2-player perspective; it was difficult to find others to invest that much time, with the perceived difficulty, given the amount of pieces in the box. However, to some extent the difficult is lessened since certain cards that one would think are different, are actually the same. For example, while there are hunter and Dracula event cards, these are combined into a single pile during play. After playing a week of rounds in the game, we had it down pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&#39;ve seen them played, I haven&#39;t played a hidden movement game like this before. I rather enjoyed how it worked, with location cards being used to track where Dracula has moved, instead of using some sort of sheet and writing locations down. It also lessens the ability for Dracula to move backwards (although he can still be tricky to locate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game works with the hunters playing once during the day and then once at night, with Dracula then going at night. This cycle repeats for each day of the week, until either Dracula is defeated, or he wins. However, if the game doesn&#39;t end after a few weeks Dracula starts gaining influence (his way of winning) at a very steady rate. So the game does have some maximum number of turns, based upon how the players do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game itself seemed relatively balanced, which I understand wasn&#39;t the case in earlier editions, with Dracula having a slight advantage. At first I found this to be slightly interesting since Dracula has a number of disadvantages, having less turns and allowing the players to find where he&#39;s been, since Dracula&#39;s last six locations can (generally) be discovered. He also can&#39;t backtrack, since the last six locations aren&#39;t part of the location deck he uses to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as was evident when Dracula was discovered to have moved into Italy, it&#39;s still possible for him to evade capture, as he did when he traveled by sea for three turns, opening up the number of possible locations he could have landed at. He can also leave behind encounters at locations he visited, which may either cause immediate harm, or if left as-is, help him slow down the hunters or finish the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last note is that unlike some games, in Fury of Dracula no player is completely out of the game. While hunters can be defeated, they eventually recover health and can continue on the quest. Each hunter has their own advantages and disadvantages, so no one hunter necessarily dominates over the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the board components themselves are of quite nice quality. The game includes five figures, which are of nice quality (and could potentially be painted), a nice quality board and cardboard pieces, and nice cards. The artwork is of note since it matches the style of the game relatively well. We did find that two of the figures were easy to mistake at a quick glance, which unfortunately did lead to combat happening with a character that should not have been in combat. However, with three or more players, closer attention, or perhaps a paint job, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. It also only happened once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the only downside I found was the amount of time it took, which was closer to four hours, but was also our first time. Otherwise, when I can find people that will play it, much like Betrayal at House on the Hill and BioShock, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1OkfQMt&#34;&gt;Fury of Dracula, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt; will be a game I&#39;ll recommend we try. 5 of 5 stars.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 Samba server (in early January 2016)</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Setting-up-a-Raspberry-Pi-2-Samba-server-%28in-early-January-2016%29/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2016 12:17:57 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Setting-up-a-Raspberry-Pi-2-Samba-server-%28in-early-January-2016%29/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is how I configured a Raspberry Pi 2 as a samba server, using a Seagate Backup Plus Slim, 1TB, drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ease I purchased the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1MZjXM0&#34;&gt;CanaKit Raspberry Pi 2 Complete Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;. It runs about $70 and includes enough to get up and running with the Raspberry Pi 2, with the Pi itself, a nice case, power supply, HDMI cable, WiFi adapter, and SD card with NOOBS/Raspbian installer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the hard drive I opted to purchase a &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1MZkg9F&#34;&gt;Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB Portable External Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt;, since I&#39;ve had good enough luck with Seagate in the past, and reviews are generally favorable. This ran me $60. I confirmed that it worked fine on my Windows 10 machine, and was already formatted to NTFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once I received the Pi and drive I found that the power supply/Pi wasn&#39;t putting off enough power to keep the drive running. After looking at the options, including tweaking the Pi to pass through more power through the USB connector, I opted to pick up a powered USB hub instead (especially since I was considering setting up a camera at some point in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this I went with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1MZktd6&#34;&gt;AmazonBasics 4 Port USB 3.0 Hub with 5V/2.5A power adapter&lt;/a&gt; for about $17. Reviews are quite favorable, and I didn&#39;t see any indication that it wouldn&#39;t work. Once I received the included manual does note that Windows 2000 through 8 are required, or Mac OS X. However, as you&#39;ll see there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before powering my Raspberry Pi 2 up I went ahead and plugged the USB Hub into the Pi, and the Seagate Backup Plus into the HUB. I powered up the HUB first, and then powered up the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was a couple years old, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.howtogeek.com/139433/how-to-turn-a-raspberry-pi-into-a-low-power-network-storage-device/&#34;&gt;How to Turn a Raspberry Pi into a Low-Power Network Storage Device&lt;/a&gt; worked fairly well for the setup steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup commands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise noted, all commands were run on the Raspberry Pi 2 itself, at the command line, outside of Raspbian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the guide suggests installing &lt;strong&gt;ntfs-3g&lt;/strong&gt;, this was already installed on my Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a listing of the disks, &lt;code&gt;sudo fdisk -l&lt;/code&gt;, returned /dev/sda1 for the name of the Seagate drive. So, despite a moment of worry, the Amazon USB Hub worked perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to setup the drive. I opted for all lowercase when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /media/usbhdd1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was the mounting of the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /media/usbhdd1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the directory I setup a new shares directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /media/usbhdd1/shares
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first tried to install Samba I received a number of errors. A quick update resolved the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I was able to install Samba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup the Samba configuration, just in case, and then open the config in &lt;strong&gt;nano&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.old
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Windows 10 machine was already on the WORKGROUP workgroup, so I didn&#39;t have to touch this, but verify &lt;em&gt;workgroup&lt;/em&gt; is set as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the guide I was unable to find a security line in the Authenication section, so I skipped that for now, and promised to try to get in without authenticating before I went too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the config I added the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Backup1]
comment = Backup Folder
path = /media/usbhdd1/shares
valid users = @users
force group = users
create mask = 0660
directory mask = 0771
read only = no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CTRL+X&lt;/code&gt; will exit, and allow you to save. Press &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; to just overwrite the existing file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart the Samba service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now setup a user account in UNIX and then for Samba. Yes, this means entering the password 4 times. Personally, I&#39;m a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/&#34;&gt;Preshing&#39;s xkcd Password Generator&lt;/a&gt; and storing the credentials in &lt;a href=&#34;http://keepass.info/&#34;&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo useradd backups -m -G users
sudo passwd backups
sudo smbpasswd -a backups
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ease I then determined the ip of the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ifconfig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I just browsed to that directly in Windows explorer (&lt;code&gt;\\192.168.x.x&lt;/code&gt;). Thankfully I was prompted for credentials when I tried to access the &lt;strong&gt;Backup1&lt;/strong&gt; directory. Entering the credentials I had created above worked great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to put some data in the directory. Over my wireless network speeds weren&#39;t fantastic, but it worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I verified the files had been copied over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /media/usbhdd1/shares
ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was a step I almost forgot, which was to have the Raspberry Pi automatically mount the drive after rebooting. The config first needed to be opened in nano, &lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, and then I had to add the following, which I did so at the end of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/sda1    /media/usbhdd1     auto    noatime     0       0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + x&lt;/code&gt; as usual to exit, save, and overwrite the existing file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, restart the Raspberry Pi itself to verify that I could still get to the share after it came back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo reboot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Google Services on the Amazon Fire HD 8</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Google-Services-on-the-Amazon-Fire-HD-8/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 14:35:42 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Google-Services-on-the-Amazon-Fire-HD-8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;xda-developers has a post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/general/installing-google-framework-playstore-t3216122&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34;&gt;Installing Google Framework/Playstore without Root (5th Gen Amazon Fire 2015)&lt;/a&gt;, that includes a couple different sets of instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What worked for me was grabbing the mega.nz zip download and then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you&#39;re a developer and you allow apps from unknown sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install ES File Explorer via the Amazon Appstore. It&#39;s something I install on all my Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the contents of the zip you downloaded from Mega somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect your Fire tablet to your computer via a USB cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy all the files to the Download directory on your tablet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ES File Explorer navigate to the Download directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install com.android.vending-5.9-12*.apk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install com.google.android.gms-6.6.03*.apk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install GoogleLoginService.apk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install GoogleServicesFramework.apk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off and then turn back on the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can try opening Google Play. If it automatically closes (it did for me), install com.android.vending-5.9.12*.apk again. When I did so it asked me if I wanted to install the update, and referenced one of the other services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should be able to run the Google Play application now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted, you can safely update the Google services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google Play installed I was able to login to Google, as well as install YouTube and Chrome to my Fire HD 8.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Adonit Jot Dash - Fine Point Precision Stylus</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the Adonit Jot Dash - Fine Point Precision Stylus, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Not what I was expecting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part I&#39;m not yet at the point in my life where I need to use a stylus pen for my electronic devices. My fingers are the right size, and with devices getting larger, I don&#39;t need the precision. I&#39;m also not much of an artist, so it&#39;s not necessary to draw. However, with Windows 10 ending up on almost all my devices, and touch screens on all my laptops, I did want to try using a stylus for some creative outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before receiving this as part of the Amazon Vine program I was using, off and on, a pen with the nub on the eraser part that would be picked up by touch devices. However, since I had played with it, or because it was cheap, the nub wouldn&#39;t stay on. The opportunity to try a real stylus was something I was looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1HPVyaN&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34;&gt;Adonit Jot Dash - Fine Point Precision Stylus&lt;/a&gt; wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. I love how the stylus feels in my hand, and I like how it looks. The magnetic charging base is pretty nice, as it allowed me to hang it down from the USB drive on my primary PC during charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested it with a Samsung Galaxy S4, 2nd Gen Nexus 7, and two Asus tablets/laptops running Windows 10. On all devices it was recognized without issue, without having to install or enable anything. However, it didn&#39;t perform as well as I would like. On both my Android devices it seemed a little off. What may have been the cause is how I actually used it, since the tip isn&#39;t as soft as I would have liked. Instead, every time I used it I felt as though if I pressed down too hard I&#39;d end up with a scratch in my screen or screen protector. While it hasn&#39;t caused any damage, I do wish it had a bit of give, or was more rounded than it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did like the simple indicator when the device is powered on/off (green or red light). It&#39;s relatively simple to use, so it doesn&#39;t include any instructions in the box, just a few paragraphs on the back on how to power it on. It being rechargeable is also quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, since it doesn&#39;t include any software, multi-touch devices may still register other input (such as palm) when this device is used. I also really wish the tip felt softer, so I wasn&#39;t afraid to use it. For these reasons I give the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1HPVyaN&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34;&gt;Adonit Jot Dash - Fine Point Precision Stylus&lt;/a&gt; a neutral 3 of 5 stars, which would have translated to a 3.5 if I could have. It definitely works with every device I tried it with, but I think my usage will be limited, and only with devices that have screen protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer for Face/Hair</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Panasonic-ER-GB60-K-Precision-Beard-and-Hair-Trimmer-for-FaceHair/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 17:20:10 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Panasonic-ER-GB60-K-Precision-Beard-and-Hair-Trimmer-for-FaceHair/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1O06RSk&#34;&gt;Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer for Face/Hair&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Spoiler: I really like them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finally, something that works with my beard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away I&#39;ll say that I haven&#39;t used these to clip the hair on the top of my head. I have some barbershop-quality clippers from Wahl that I use for that, and I&#39;ve had no reason to try anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for my beard I&#39;ve tried a few clippers, the last of which were a lower-end set of Wahl clippers. They worked okay but they just didn&#39;t seem to clip as well as they should. Since I&#39;m on a quest to find something that will work for my beard, when I saw these through the Amazon Vine program I knew I had to give them a go. And now, after trying the Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer, I have no reason to search any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Panasonic ER-GB60-K is pretty simple, with only two set of clipper guards. However, these can be moved by the adjustable knob built into the body of the clippers to support a wide range of beard lengths. The maximum length is 20mm, so if you want something longer you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere. However, between the two guards you can get 1-20mm of length, so a great range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really does it for me is how well these clips. My professional Wahl clippers cut every time, while the lower end ones would end up tugging a bit on hairs (I blame the short blades). The blades on these clippers are on par with the professional Wahl ones, which means that you can expect hairs to be cut each time, no pulling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with holding the clippers, and the cut angle feels natural. This doesn&#39;t have any attachments, however, so if you want to trim any smaller areas these won&#39;t work. However, for the beard this won&#39;t be an issue, and you might use scissors to be a little more precise on a mustache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that slightly worries me is the adjustable knob itself. I&#39;ve never had it slip, but for some reason it just doesn&#39;t click as solidly as I&#39;d like. Again, I haven&#39;t experienced any issues with it, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ll keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1O06RSk&#34;&gt;Panasonic ER-GB60-K Precision Beard and Hair Trimmer&lt;/a&gt; exceeded my expectations, and is absolutely worth a full 5 of 5 stars. If you have a beard in the 1-20mm range, definitely give this a look.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Homeland: The Game</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Homeland-The-Game/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 18:51:19 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Homeland-The-Game/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1OH1avz&#34;&gt;Homeland: The Game&lt;/a&gt;, provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A sort of board game Resistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through the rules for the first time I kept thinking about the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1PFllJu&#34;&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt; (although there are many games like this). In The Resistance every character is either part of the resistance, or part of a group trying to sabotage them. As the game progresses you start to figure out who&#39;s who, in an attempt to score a win for your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeland: The Game, is sort of like that, although here you have terrorists, politicians, and the feds, with the terrorist trying to cause havoc, the feds trying to prevent it, and the politicians trying for a &#39;healthy&#39; amount of both. Like other variants missions come in, with each player playing as needed. However, in this game it might turn out that you can only play cards that will threaten the mission, even though you want it to be squashed, and vice versa. There&#39;s also, depending upon how many people you play with, a chance that there won&#39;t even be a terrorist or politician in the game (there&#39;s always at least one of two though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first open the box you might be surprised by the thickness of the rules, combined with the number of pieces you need to punch out. However, the rules do have a number of photos from the show (which I have not seen). They&#39;re still a little complicated, but as you play you&#39;ll get the hang of it pretty quickly. It also comes with cards detailing the turn actions, which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board itself is a little unfortunate. It&#39;s constructed well enough, but it&#39;s sliced in an odd spot. As the game progresses you end up moving cards from one end of the board to the other. However, the way it was cut results in the inability to smoothly slide half the board&#39;s cards up. A cut from north to south, instead of left to right, would have been preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the cards are also half-sized, but the way these are actually used during play works out rather well. It just results in a little trouble shuffling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game will play 3 to 6 players, with a length of 90 minutes. The more players you have the more tricky it might be (in a good way), but you can also expect play to go longer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many others I haven&#39;t seen the show, so I can&#39;t speak to that, but I hope to get in a game with someone who has seen it (and also loves these types of games), and will update the review once that&#39;s happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I give &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1OH1avz&#34;&gt;Homeland: The Game&lt;/a&gt; a 5 of 5. I&#39;ll update once I&#39;ve had the opportunity to play with more people, but the components are well constructed (minus the cut placement in the board), the game plays well without needing to know the source material, and it even comes with, very nice, little marines and agents you can use during the game. Recommended for people who like games like The Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart (2012)</title>

      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Nightmares-from-the-Deep-The-Cursed-Heart-2012/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/259740/&#34;&gt;Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart&lt;/a&gt; (2012), available on Steam and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1WbKptb&#34;&gt;for physical purchase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A good way to get into the genre&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I played the Steam version of this game, and this review is based upon that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first real hidden object game I played, thanks to a kind Reddit user who gifted me a key. It was actually quite good, with great artwork. The animated bits suffer from a bit of pixelation, but it doesn&#39;t detract too much from the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzles are relatively easy, but the hint option is there if you need it (just make sure you don&#39;t accidentally hit it while walking about :( ). It took me about four and a half hours to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/259740/&#34;&gt;Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart&lt;/a&gt; gets four of five stars, and seems to be a good way to get into the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous Base Set</title>
      <link>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Base-Set/</link>

      <guid>http://words.strivinglife.com/post/Review-Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Wrath-of-the-Righteous-Base-Set/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1FLqFDn&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34;&gt;Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous Base Set&lt;/a&gt;, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Too soon to tell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game available from Amazon Vine I jumped on the chance to give it a try. Unfortunately the complexities of the game currently result in this partial review. This review will be updated in the coming days and weeks as we further play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game jumped out at me is because the idea of a tabletop RPG has appealed to me for a very long time, but I don&#39;t have the group of friends that (I thought) would be interested in it. It seems you need someone who&#39;s interested in DMing or GMing, and I just don&#39;t know anyone like that anymore. The premise behind the card game version of Pathfinder is that you don&#39;t need a gamemaster (GM), as each player is, to some extent, that role. See also the Sentinels card game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The box itself contains another room for the base set and the eventual expansions. I think I would have liked it to be a bit more like Dominion, where you could see where the cards went without consulting the rules, and so that the various expansions could be slipped in without keeping their original packaging. However, it works for what it is, and I think it&#39;s fine in the sense of each player keeping a consistent character over the course of the game. I have no fear about the components getting mixed up when the box is closed (although one corner or another tended to stick a bit every time I tried to close it), and it tends to sit on it&#39;s side when not in use. It&#39;s a big box though, so lugging it back and forth resulted in me giving up and just leaving it at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are pretty dense, and while I had read them before hand we ended up reading them as a group before starting as well. You can also expect the initial setup to take at least 30 minutes, so plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cards themselves seem to be of a good stock, and feature some really fantastic artwork. In a way it almost made me recall decades ago when I played Magic: The Gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ... that&#39;s sadly all I can really say at this point, since we realized we were playing wrong and restarted our adventure. But from what I&#39;ve seen thus far, the quality of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1FLqFDn&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34;&gt;Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Wrath of the Righteous Base Set&lt;/a&gt; gives it a current 4 star rating. Updates will be woven into the review, and noted at the bottom of this review.&lt;/p&gt;
