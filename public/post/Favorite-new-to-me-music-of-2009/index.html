<p>Keeping with the tradition started here, a <a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Favorite-new-to-me-music-of-2010.aspx">list for 2010</a> is also available.</p>
</div>
<p>Having only listened to the radio a few times over the last year, I have a good idea of just what music I&rsquo;ve listened to, since my iPod keeps track of everything.</p>
<p>With the help of <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">iTunes Playlists to Xml</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://strivinglife.com/words/?tag=/linqpad">LINQPad</a>, here&rsquo;s my favorite new (to me) album purchases of 2009.</p>
<p>To be on this list I must have purchased the album in 2009. This also doesn&rsquo;t include all albums I purchased.</p>
<h3>Easy winners</h3>
<p>These are the albums that easily are my favorites of 2009. To be on this list I&rsquo;ve had them for a while and enjoy almost every song on the album, and am almost always in the mood to listen to them.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D7CYEY?tag=strivinglifen-20">Meiko</a> - Meiko : My only problem with this album is that Meiko hasn&rsquo;t seemed to have produced anything since. Near perfect album.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UIPI6W?tag=strivinglifen-20">(A)spera</a> - Mirah : For whatever reason, I had to re-find Mirah on my iPod. Unfortunately when I later&nbsp;picked up <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013D86FO?tag=strivinglifen-20">Advisory Committee</a>, hoping I could find another album like this, it just didn&rsquo;t have the same feel &hellip; although the first song is of course great.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TRVK5S?tag=strivinglifen-20">Fur and Gold</a> - Bat for Lashes : Their cover of I&rsquo;m On Fire was what originally got me interested in Bat for Lashes, but she&rsquo;s got a very solid voice, with stories behind her lyris. After getting burned before, I hesitated picking up <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YAG5DQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Two Suns</a>. While I still like Fur and Gold more, I&rsquo;ve started to get into the latter (especially after seeing the music video for Daniel, and realizing just how much imagery there is in that album as well).</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027D41PS?tag=strivinglifen-20">Still Night, Still Light</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QZY97E?tag=strivinglifen-20">Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation</a>&nbsp;- Au Revoir Simone : With&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QZV616?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Bird of Music</a> (not otherwise listed), I believe I have all of Au Revoir Simone&rsquo;s albums (including the remix album, which is listed below). These two are easy to start when I want to fill up a short time with some nice music. I&rsquo;m still undecided about Bird, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d pick up a new Au Revoir Simone album.</p>
<h3>Close calls</h3>
<p>The following albums are those that I enjoy, but that don&rsquo;t immediately come to mind, or require me to be in a particular mood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001456HMK?tag=strivinglifen-20">Speak for Yourself</a> - Imogen Heap : I think I found this on Last.fm. Unfortunately, while I was really looking forward to her new album <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K3XECQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Ellipse</a>, I&rsquo;ll admit I was expecting a &lsquo;Speak for Yourself 2.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T9E7U?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Flower Book</a> - &Eacute;milie Simon : When I first picked this album up I listened to again and again. While I&rsquo;ve slowed down a bit, I still really like this, and picked up her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T9DTO?tag=strivinglifen-20">March of the Empress</a>, and have been very tempted to pick up her live album.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012EJVIA?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Con</a> - Tegan and Sara : Tegan and Sara is another hit-or-miss group, but I listened to this album quite a lot when I first picked it up. I really like this, but haven&rsquo;t been able to get into <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014JIUX0?tag=strivinglifen-20">So Jealous</a>, which has stopped me from picking up their new album.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122ZAI2?tag=strivinglifen-20">5:55</a> - Charlotte Gainsbourg : I listened to this quite a lot when I picked it up, and there&rsquo;s some songs I love, but I&rsquo;m afraid that listening to it so much as decreased my appreciation of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXMS9A?tag=strivinglifen-20">Nolita</a> - Keren Ann : Another that I listened to a lot when I first picked it up. She&rsquo;s got a solid voice, and Song of Alice, song by another, is one of my favorite songs. I picked up <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXBRJW?tag=strivinglifen-20">La Biographie De Luka Philipse</a> and haven&rsquo;t been able to get into it as much as I&rsquo;d like. Again, this has stopped me from picking up more of her work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZ8RB2?tag=strivinglifen-20">Psych&eacute;d&eacute;lices</a> - Aliz&eacute;e : $25, this was by far the most expensive music purchase this year, but that&rsquo;s what happens when you have to pay import pricing, and you can&rsquo;t get it electronically. Didn&rsquo;t listen to it as much as her other albums, but nonetheless it&rsquo;s pretty solid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013DAC8I?tag=strivinglifen-20">Let It Die</a> - Feist : Between this and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9D0XY?tag=strivinglifen-20">The Reminder</a> Feist has enough songs to keep me rather happy. But, I&rsquo;ve got to be in just the right mood &hellip;</p>
<h3>Too hard to tell</h3>
<p>These are albums that I like, but have a hard time putting into the above listing, for whatever reason. Or, they may be albums that I haven&rsquo;t had for very long, so it&rsquo;s too soon to tell.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZO2S0?tag=strivinglifen-20">Melankton</a> - Kate Havnevik : Really great music, but I have to keep remembering that I like this. Why doesn&rsquo;t it jump out at me more? Is it like (A)spera where it&rsquo;ll eventually click? This puzzles me. Maybe I just need to be in the mood for it? Or is it the length (oddly enough)?</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00150ASXS?tag=strivinglifen-20">11:11</a> - Maria Taylor and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RK1ZRY?tag=strivinglifen-20">Azure Ray</a> - Azure Ray : Maria Taylor being a part of Azure Ray, these two are closely related. I should just pick up another Azure Ray album and get it done with.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V3VT42?tag=strivinglifen-20">Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?</a> - Metric : I picked up <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W4LA3E?tag=strivinglifen-20">Fantasies</a> first, and enjoyed it enough to seek out more of Metric&rsquo;s works, but like Old World more. This is another where I just need to pick up another of their album&rsquo;s to see what happens.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KQGCVO?tag=strivinglifen-20">Happy Smiles</a> - T.A.T.U. : T.A.T.U. is one of my guilty pleasures, after hearing about them and purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JH2M?tag=strivinglifen-20">T.A.T.U.: The Best</a>. I <em>just</em> found out they released another album &hellip; which I&rsquo;ll probably pick up after I finish this post.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YAG5DQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Two Suns</a> - Bat for Lashes : <em>See my note on Bat for Lashes above.</em> Again, I really want to like this one.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YMY1FY?tag=strivinglifen-20">Structure &amp; Cosmetics</a> - The Brunettes : This is one of a very few albums featuring a male singer that made it on the positive lists. The two work so well together on this album.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEDBV4?tag=strivinglifen-20">Re-Arrange Us</a> - Mates of State : Living in Madison, or knowing the people I knew, I saw a lot of Mates of State stickers, but I&rsquo;d never really listened to them. Enjoy them, but have a hard time unconsciously pressing the play button when I get to them &hellip;</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q1QF2O?tag=strivinglifen-20">It&rsquo;s Not Me, It&rsquo;s You</a> - Lily Allen : Somehow a copy of Smile ended up on my computer, I believe from when I was trying to fix my sister&rsquo;s computer (or at least get all her data back). <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TETLRA?tag=strivinglifen-20">Alright, Still</a> is still a great album, and this one is a pretty good follow-up.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SX89TS?tag=strivinglifen-20">Moon Safari</a> - Air : Sounds great, but since I&rsquo;m okay with this being my only Air album, I have a hard time moving it higher.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V7EQ24?tag=strivinglifen-20">It&rsquo;s Blitz!</a> - Yeah Yeah Yeahs : Played it quite a bit when I got it, but it&rsquo;s hard to press play unless I&rsquo;m in the mood.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011FDUR8?tag=strivinglifen-20">Too</a> - Madita : I picked up this and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TT1PUQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Madita</a> at the same time. Too starts very well, but I have a hard time getting excited much beyond that. I purchased this when I was iTunes-only for MP3s; I just now realized that Amazon seems to be short on her work, and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00138F080?tag=strivinglifen-20">Oracular Spectacular</a> - MGMT : Listened to it a lot when I got it, but have had a hard time since.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R20GWW?tag=strivinglifen-20">Rendezvous</a>&nbsp;- French Affair : I just need to purchase another album. I like this, but have to make a conscious decision to choose it.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L4BQVA?tag=strivinglifen-20">Kate Earl</a> - Kate Earl : Having just purchased this, it&rsquo;s far too soon to tell.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00260NOMS?tag=strivinglifen-20">Dancing The Whole Way Home</a> - Miss Li : Another that I just purchased, but if I keep going as I am, this is one that will be near the top of my most played list &hellip; and I&rsquo;ll have a few more of her albums in my collection.</p>
<h3>Disappointments</h3>
<p>And here are the albums that I wish I could take back.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U7VTNA?tag=strivinglifen-20">Underachievers Please Try Harder</a> - Camera Obscura : Here&rsquo;s another one that starts out good but quickly loses it&rsquo;s flavor.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I851AM?tag=strivinglifen-20">Reverse Migration</a> - Au Revoir Simone : While Au Revoir Simone made it on the top of my list, this album, consisting of remixes, is hit or miss. There are some songs I enjoy more here than the originals, but overall I should have just purchased one of their original albums sooner, saving this for last.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TERLEK?tag=strivinglifen-20">X &amp; Y</a> - Coldplay : If I wanted to listen to Bono, I&rsquo;d listen to the U2 album I own.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TEVHOU?tag=strivinglifen-20">Angel Milk</a> - T&eacute;l&eacute;popmusik : I knew I needed to get something by this group, but it seems this was the wrong one to start with &hellip; or was it?</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168IJH6?tag=strivinglifen-20">Reasonable Doubt</a> - Jay-Z : Maybe it was the wrong Jay-Z album to start with?</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011YZ0VS?tag=strivinglifen-20">Four Thieves Gone - The Robbinsville Sessions</a> - The Avett Brothers : I taped my feet while I was listening to previews, and thought it was a good recommendation, but haven&rsquo;t listened to it after the first play.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K3XECQ?tag=strivinglifen-20">Ellipse</a> - Imogen Heap : Speak for Yourself 2 it is not. It&rsquo;s got some okay songs, but &hellip;</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QQUXSM?tag=strivinglifen-20">Oaklandazulasylum</a> - Why? : After some really good recommendations from my sister, I was hoping this would be another good one. It wasn&rsquo;t, and even seeing them play in Madison didn&rsquo;t help much.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013D8G7C?tag=strivinglifen-20">Unplugged</a> - Alicia Keys : A guilty pleasure, I&rsquo;ve liked her other albums, but I just don&rsquo;t find her as good live.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QD7SF0?tag=strivinglifen-20">Working On a Dream</a> - Bruce Springsteen : I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Springsteen, but whether it&rsquo;s because my tastes have changed, or he&rsquo;s just not as good as he once was, this album was&nbsp;a big disappointment for me. Seeing as how my feelings on his other albums have changed over time, I&rsquo;m hoping I just need to get a bit older to get into this.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>And there it is.</p></p>
