<div class="note">
<p>The following email was sent moments ago, to the contacts listed for the two addresses below.</p>
</div>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>This morning, from approximately 2:15 to 2:30 am, a number of spam messages were posted to the blog at strivinglife.com/words/ .</p>
<p>These comments all originated from the ip 216.8.168.77, for which you are listed as the abuse contact.</p>
<p>Because of the way this particular system is setup, and the time between comments, this seems to have been an actual human being posting these comments. However, it's possible that one of the computers using your service has been infected. Either way, I wished to inform you of this.</p>
<p>The user-agent reported is as follows: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)</p>
<p>Note that all of the links in these spam posts pointed to the domain laptopbuyer.info ( <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/laptopbuyer.info">http://whois.domaintools.com/laptopbuyer.info</a> ), also seemingly based in Ontario.</p>
<p>However, assuming the best scenario, I'm CCing the contact for that domain, so they are aware that someone may be attempting to temporarily increase search engine ranking, followed by long-term harm to the domain.</p>
<p>If you require additional information from me, please let me know. Also, I would prefer to be kept in the loop, as much as possible, as to the resolution of this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>~James</p>
