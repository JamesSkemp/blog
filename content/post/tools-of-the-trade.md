<p>
Thanks to my sister still being in school, I&#39;ve been able to pick up a number of very powerful commercial tools for fairly cheap.  I&#39;m big on free programs - Open Source being the key word these days - but sometimes the professional&#39;s tools are just more than all that.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
That said, here&#39;s my pick of essential tools.  If the items come in a group, or individually, I&#39;ve mentioned the group and the &#39;essentials&#39; underneath.  &#39;Essentials&#39; for what?  Well, these just happen to be the programs that I can&#39;t go very long without :)

<ul>
	<li>Macromedia Studio 8
	<ul>
		<li>Dreamweaver and Flash</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Adobe Creative Suite 2
	<ul>
		<li>Photoshop and Acrobat</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Firefox 1.5
	<ul>
		<li>with the Web Developer and HTML Validator extensions</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>additional browsers as necessary - check your Web site&#39;s traffic, or world-wide trends</li>
	<li>file comparision utility, like WinMerge</li>
	<li>a FTP client like Core FTP or FileZilla</li>
	<li>a good office program, like Microsoft Office or OpenOffice</li>
	<li>an email provider that allows large storage limits, and an easy way to receive notifications of new email
	<ul>
		<li>I use Gmail and Gmail Talk</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>a good chat utility, if you&#39;ll be working with a group of people, like Trillian</li>
	<li>a good computer &#39;management&#39; (?) utility, like Coolmon, SysMetrix, or Samurize - what&#39;s your RAM, disk space, and network connection like? there&#39;s a quick way to find this out, and the rather slow way</li>
	<li>if you&#39;re looking at IP addresses and domains, Sam Spade is going to be a big help</li>
	<li>MWSnap, &#39;cause sometimes you just need a small screenshot without loading a number of other tools</li>
	<li>XnView or IrfanView, &#39;cause sometimes you just don&#39;t need to load Photoshop for an easy task</li>
	<li>a good zip utility, like 7-Zip</li>
	<li>Knoppix - see how one of the other groups works</li>
	<li>having a similar setup to your host&#39;s computer - in my case, Apache, PHP, and MySQL installed on my computer. being able to type http://localhost/ in a browser and having it load an actual page is something that any serious Web person should have, even if you&#39;re only creating a small site</li>
</ul>
<p>
That&#39;s probably it, right there.  I&#39;ll unfortunately think of more, but on the bright side I&#39;ll be able to add a couple of alternatives (like HTML-Kit) that wouldn&#39;t suit my needs, but would at least be something.
