<p>
Review for Sin: The Movie (1999); given 2 of 5 stars.

These characters were completely new to me (at least, from what I can
recall). Needing to burn some &lsquo;Watch Now&rsquo; time, I decided to give this
a look, and was quite disappointed (even though I wasn&rsquo;t expecting
much). After 15 minutes, I was ready to quit, but I figured it couldn&rsquo;t
get any more confusing and decided to stick with it; I should have
stopped.

I agree with a number of the other reviewers; it seems more like a
season finale episode, or a regularly scheduled cartoon then a real
movie. The plot seems difficult to nail down, and the action is really
the only thing keeping it moving, and even that gets crazier and
crazier as the movie goes on.

<p>
While not rated, this is probably PG or PG-13 material.

The movie wasn&rsquo;t worth the 57 minutes - only some of the ideas
(albeit ones that have been recycled over and over) provided saving
grace &hellip;
