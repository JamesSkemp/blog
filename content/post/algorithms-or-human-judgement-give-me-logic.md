Earlier today, it was noted in the news that Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is working with Amazon on a search engine.&nbsp; This new engine supposedly will use human judgement to weight results.&nbsp; Naturally, sources are saying that this engine&#39;s competition is Google.&nbsp; While Web 2.0 has some good things going for it, this is one of the silliest ideas I&#39;ve heard of in a long time.
</p>
<p>
First, DMOZ anyone?&nbsp; Want your site to show up high in the DMOZ directory? Bribe a DMOZ editor.&nbsp; It&#39;s not hard.
</p>
<p>
Want your site or service to be posted on Digg?&nbsp; No, your money <em>is</em> good with Digg posters.
</p>
<p>
Maybe people are intrinsically good (I like to think that they are neither good nor evil/bad in their original state/position), but thousands and thousands or years of evolution and humanity has resulted in man being less than perfect.
</p>
<p>
With people already trying to cheat the mathematical algorithms that the best SEs (Search Engines) use, how is a human-based search engine going to do any better?&nbsp; What we really are talking about, when we talk about human judged search results is a <strong>directory</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Putting aside the cheating and lying, the Wikipedia is a great example of this - probably one of the best out there (that I know of - comment if you know of anything potentially better).&nbsp; The content, taken with a grain of salt, includes links to external sources.&nbsp; For technical/Web-based items, you bet I&#39;ll hit the Wiki, as there&#39;s probably going to be at least one link on any article that points to the essentials (id est, the essential information).
</p>
<p>
Anything more than this and you have to account for man&#39;s selfishness, pride, and greed.&nbsp; As with the Wiki, it will be essential for individuals to have &#39;super&#39; powers, the ability to lock items down, as well as the need to educate users that the service should be taken with a grain of salt.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you have to do that with search engines now, for black-hat SEOs and the rest are interested in few things as much as the green, but ... when it comes to billions of sites, give me an algorithm-based search engine any day.
</p>
<p>
After all, how else are we to find the sites for our directory in the first place?&nbsp; User submission?
</p>
<h4>On a related note ...</h4>
<p>
One thing that I would like to see in future versions of search engines is the ability to have some control over how my sites are listed.&nbsp; Using sitemaps, I can already tell Google that I own such-and-such domains, but it would be nice to give my results some credibility.
</p>
<p>
&quot;This site&#39;s Webmaster has registered with us, and here&#39;s their information.&quot;&nbsp; (Information could be basic contact information, a Web page address, or what-have-you.)&nbsp; I don&#39;t know, but it seems like a semi-good idea.&nbsp; If the site is &#39;trouble&#39;, then the search engine could be notified of this.&nbsp; You could potentially tie this into user reviews of the site as well.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there&#39;s a number of sites out there that do this, but that&#39;s the problem - there&#39;s a <em>number</em> of sites that do this.&nbsp; (Again, why trust people in general when there&#39;s at least half-a-dozen sites for every possible idea out there?&nbsp; Why not consolidate, and allow branching that&#39;s linked to the original site/group?)&nbsp; Why build another site when, given sufficient numbers, you can make an existing site better?
</p>

A unicorn, perhaps.
