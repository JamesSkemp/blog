<p>
Logically speaking, the rule of Double Negation tells us that p :: ~~p. In order words, if something is blue, it is not not blue. Unfortunately, this is one of the <a href="/words/post/Rules-for-Sentential-Logic.aspx">rules for sentential logic</a> that is philosophically troubling.<!--more--><!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a simple example to show this; happy. We then have the following:
</p>
<p>
happy :: not not happy
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
I am happy :: I am not not happy
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
I am happy :: I am not unhappy
</p>
<p>
Now, if we are in fact declaring that we are happy, there is no problem with double negation in this case. Yet, if the declaration is the other way, it&#39;s not so easy to double negate.
</p>
<p>
In this case, it may be more because there is a third option; I am neither happy nor unhappy. In states of affairs in which there are only two options, double negation will serve us well. If something is blue, then it&#39;s not not blue. If I&#39;m unhappy, then I&#39;m not happy.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s therefore important to realize cases in which there are not merely two options, but potentially three or more. In such cases, double negation will do us little good.
