<p>The newest versions of Subversion and TortoiseSVN were released just last week.</p>
<p>My install guides for <a href="/words/post/Installing-Subversion-to-Windows-Vista.aspx">Subversion on Vista</a> (and another with <a href="/words/post/Installing-Subversion-binaries-for-Apache-22x.aspx">Subversion on Vista with Apache 2.2.x</a>) and <a href="/words/post/Installing-TortoiseSVN-to-Windows-Vista.aspx">TortoiseSVN on Vista</a>&nbsp;are still applicable.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>If installing Subversion with Apache 2.2.x, make sure you stop Apache before replacing files.</p>
