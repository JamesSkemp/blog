Dice Rolling With a Bit of Setup, But Enjoyable First, if you&rsquo;re not very lucky with dice, you should probably move on as Order of the Gilded Compass relies very heavily upon the luck of the roll.
Two to five players take turns rolling dice, assigning some number of them before play continues to the next player.

Cooperative and Atmospheric, But Probably Best With A Single Group of Four London Dread is a cooperative board game for two to four players, where they attempt to travel around London over the course of a day or two, investigating areas, tackling location events, before taking on an antagonist, and then eventually moving on to another story.

Amazing Components, Unique Gameplay, for Dedicated Players/Fans Recently I started really getting into the second edition of Descent, where a single player plays as the overload, and up to four other players take on the roles of adventures in either one-off missions or as part of a larger campaign.
So when I had the opportunity to try out the new Conan Board Game, I leapt on the chance.

A Nice Bump From Mysterium, But Don&rsquo;t Expect Short Games I picked up a copy of Mysterium back in July 2016, and recently picked up a copy of the Hidden Signs expansion, since my girlfriend wanted to play the game every time we had a game night, and when she&rsquo;s interested in a game I try to keep her interested in it.

Messy Rule &lsquo;Book&rsquo; Requires Future Updates or House Rules First, while a friend and I started playing the Magicka PC game, we didn&rsquo;t get far before quitting. So I have only a minor understanding of the video game that Magicka Mayhem is based upon. However, this game requires no knowledge of the source material.

Thematic Dice Rolling Game, For Better or Worse I know very little about Luchadors, other than that they wear pretty distinctive masks and attire. And I know something about wrestling having been a young boy in the 80s and 90s.
Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice doesn&rsquo;t require that you know much more than that, as it does a fairly good job of being quite thematic out of the box.

A Very Nice Upgrade to the Original Game I originally purchased Citadels, with The Dark City expansion back in October 2014. I played the game a handful of times and generally enjoyed it, although games pretty consistently took closer to 60 minutes than 20 minutes (the box suggests games take between 20 to 60 minutes).

Interesting Dynamic Makes for a Fun, Quick, Game I&rsquo;m familiar with the Dystopian Universe having played The Resistance and Coup. However, no knowledge of the universe is required, and outside of the currency and general aesthetic, this game isn&rsquo;t tightly tied to the rest.
Additionally, while both The Resistance and Coup involve secret identities, Grifters instead involves recruiting characters and then using them either individually for their special abilities, or in a team to complete jobs.

Simple to learn, but very strategic and enjoyable In Onitama each player has a master and four pupil pawns. Then five move cards are pulled out, with the rest placed back in the box. Each player receives two, while the fifth is temporarily set aside, but helps determine the first player.

Beautiful game, best learned from someone else Kanagawa, as the box suggests, has some extremely beautiful artwork and components. That&rsquo;s what appealed to me about the game when I was looking at the product page, and what people I played with commented on.
But when I was reviewing the rulebook before the first game I played I was a little intimidated, and was immediately glad that someone else in the group had played before.

The Game of Stereotypes The first and only game of this I played lasted one round.
One round because we eliminated the guilty party.
One round because no one wanted to play a second game.
Initially I thought this was going to be similar to Guess Who. And it is, but how you determine the guilty party is by looking at the individual&rsquo;s photo and coming up with what stereotype(s) they match.

                                The following is a review of Tally Ho!, provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.
Surprisingly enjoyable and fair When I was initially reading the rules of Tally Ho! I was admittedly wondering how fair and fun the game was going to be. However, having now played the game I can honestly say it was both enjoyable and fair.
Tally Ho! plays out on a large board, with all but one space filled by a double-sided tile.

Interesting, but slightly complex with components that may not last First, I own and play quite a lot of games. But I played Smugglers with someone that I would consider fairly versed with games, and someone who is more into &lsquo;classic&rsquo; games. I was also going to play this with a child aged near the bottom of the recommended age range, but haven&rsquo;t had the chance yet, and might skip it based upon my experiences.

 So many pieces, but easy after a week I haven't played any of the previous editions of Fury of Dracula, so I can't speak to the changes made in this third edition. However, as I understand it, the game has changed for the better.
This supports 2 to 5 players, with one player controlling Dracula and the others controlling one or more of the hunters.

 A sort of board game Resistance Reading through the rules for the first time I kept thinking about the game The Resistance (although there are many games like this). In The Resistance every character is either part of the resistance, or part of a group trying to sabotage them. As the game progresses you start to figure out who's who, in an attempt to score a win for your team.

 A pleasant twist on the SET card game I was introduced to the SET card game a little over four years ago by a former co-worker. Having more experience than I, she kicked my butt every time we played together, but it was enjoyable, and I still did sufficiently good at the single player variant.

                                The following is a review of Cash N Guns Second Edition, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.
 Fun with a good group When initially reading over the instructions for Cash N Guns I wasn't sure how it would actually play. The idea of robbers trying to split the loot from a heist is pretty easy to understand, but would it play out fairly?
Having now played the game in a group of five I think it went fairly well.
