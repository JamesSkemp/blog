<p>
When I purchased my new HP a6360t, I also added in a HP Pocket Media Drive Bay, which allows me to directly connect in a HP Pocket Media Drive. 
</p>
<p>
In turn I&#39;m easily able to add 160GB or 250GB of additional drive space, whenever I need it, to store various media (documents, music, photos, videos, etcetera). 
</p>
<p>
One thing I was curious about was whether the drive I had, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UDCFVY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=strivinglifen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000UDCFVY" target="_blank">HP 160GB Pocket Media Drive</a>, could be directly connected to my Playstation 3. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it looks like they cannot be directly connected. 
</p>
<p>
If you attempt to do so, the drive appears to not have enough power to fully spin up. The front drive light flashes a couple of times while the drive spins, but then both stop, only to start back up in a few moments. Repeat.
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s unfortunate that this doesn&#39;t work, I suppose it could be expected. But, it is a little unfortunate. Perhaps with an external power supply, or if both cables were plugged in, things might function ...
