I just saw An Inconvenient Truth this afternoon.&nbsp; If you&#39;ve any desire to see it, see it.&nbsp; If you&#39;re concerned about the environment, see it.&nbsp; If you care about (extended) family members younger than yourself, see it.

What bothers me is that now that I&#39;ve seen the movie, I want to donate - I want to write, etcetera - but where&#39;s the call to action?&nbsp; Turns out it&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/becomeactive/">www.climatecrisis.net</a>

One comment on the movie: I would have liked to have seen the graphs once again at the end of the movie, during the credit crawl.&nbsp; After an hour and a half plus, we&#39;re likely to forget some of those graphs.&nbsp; Alternatively, the slideshow presentation available online (in Flash format, for example) would also be great.&nbsp; Even if people aren&#39;t willing to sit through a movie, they may be willing to watch a short slideshow ...
