<p>
I was recently asked to complete a survey after a purchase from a local GameStop.&nbsp; When asked how GameStop could be exceptional, I replied with the following:

	Being able to try out games before we make a purchase?

	I like the fact that I can read the game manual before I buy a game - one of the reasons I find myself making impulse buys when I go to GameStop. However, sometimes the manual is lacking, and it would be nice to be able to try a game out (here assuming that it&#39;s used).

Most of the things I purchase are PlayStation 2 games, some new, some used. I think it would be easy enough to have a PS2 up that we could try out for a bit near the registers ...&nbsp; It&#39;s seldom that busy, when I go, that we couldn&#39;t have a go at 10-15 minutes of game play.

Yet, I have found that associates generally know a thing or two about the games; and if you ask, they&#39;ll gladly give you some tips on your purchase.
