<p>
A leveling &#39;guide&#39; for Shadow Hearts: From the New World is now available; <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/ShadowHeartsFromTheNewWorld.xml">Shadow Hearts: From the New World leveling</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Not only should it have been written up and posted a while ago, it gave me a good chance to use XSD (XML Schema Definition). 
</p>
<p>
I tried creating one for my <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/vehicle_gas.xml">tracking my vehicles&#39; gas usage</a>, but failed. Having worked through the issues on this one, I think I now know what I did wrong. 
</p>
<p>
Next step is to work on an XSLT (XSL Transformation) for the file. 
</p>
<p>
Anywho, this covers the experience between levels, and the HP, MP, and SP for characters, per level.
