<p>
I just finished watching Perfect Blue online (via Netflix). Believing that they do influence what movies are recommended, in a good way, I had to give it four stars, out of five. In Netflix terms, that&#39;s the difference between a &quot;Really Liked It&quot; and a &quot;Loved It.&quot; However, I really wanted to give it a five stars ...<!--more-->

<p>
All-in-all, it&#39;s probably one of the most interesting films I&#39;ve seen. The animation quality, with the exception of the environments and select main characters, was fairly plain, for a film produced around 1997. For example, Royal Space Force - Wings of Honneamise, was created back in the late 80s, but characters in this movie are quite visually more appealing.<!--adsense-->

Yet, on the other hand, the style of the characters actually suggests something of their character. At the beginning of the film, for example, we are introduced to a character that adores the main character of the film. Later, he gets creepier and creepier, and we see that he is no &#39;hunchback&#39;, but rather truly monstrous.

In fact, the main character&#39;s friend, who we believe to be good-hearted, is also drawn fairly bad, but by the end of the movie we find that she is not quite what she seems.

But, the animation doesn&#39;t really impact the movie too much, or at least it shouldn&#39;t.

Perhaps the only thing that really holds this film back, after watching it, is the amount of violence. However, whether or not it&#39;s truly as violent as other films of it&#39;s genre (psychological thriller) is debatable. Perhaps it is it&#39;s animated nature that makes one believe that is more violent than it really is ...
</p>
<p>
But, that&#39;s why it gets four stars instead of five. Again, I thought the movie was great, but I would be unable to tell most of the people I know that they should watch this film. Of course, the film is hard to find, so perhaps it&#39;s best left to those few of us anyways ...

As an aside, I&#39;m a bit upset that Netflix never told me that I could watch movies online, and that I had to find out while watching a commercial for their service. Perhaps I don&#39;t watch enough television, but I would have liked to have known before May was up ... if you know what I mean.
