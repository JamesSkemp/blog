                                As previously mentioned I've been spending a good amount of time looking at HTML5/local storage in my free time. For testing purposes, I ended up putting a number of items within my video games offline application, which is fine, but results in some extraneous information on the page. To clean this up, as well as to allow for additional functionality, I've gone ahead and created a Web application manager for my media.jamesrskemp.com Web site.

                                I've been playing around with HTML5 quite a bit recently, in particular with offline Web applications. My second experiment (my first is on pause) was with making my video games available, so that I can access the listing when I'm out shopping at used game stores. It's still in progress, but you can see my offline listing of video games now. My main intention is to make this available on my iPod Touch, so I was a bit dismayed when I found that the listing didn't display the title of the game.

                                Having recently picked up an iPod Touch, to replace my Classic, I've become very interested in HTML5's ability to navigate content offline. In my environment I decided to create a separate directory for my manifest files. I'm also running IIS 7, on Server 2008 R2, so .manifest files are already defined for WPF. So that that isn't an issue, I created a Web.config file in the manifest directory with the below contents.

                                Techmeme had a couple of interesting titles this evening. "Kinect is Selling 2X as Fast as the iPad" and "Microsoft: Over 2.5M Kinect Sold." Even if I thought I had the space for it (I'd have to move furniture every time I wanted to play it in my current apartment) I still wouldn't pick up the Kinect. Why? First there's the price. At $150 you might as well buy a PSP (which I did) or a Nintendo DSi.

                                On the first of the month I purchased a Sony PlayStation Portable, which was delivered to me on the 4th. Since then I've used it, mostly for play, for approximately 24 hours. Approximately 23 hours and 12 minutes of that was with my first game, Crisis Core; Final Fantasy VII, and the rest (which was probably over an hour) was initial setups, as well as the playing of a handful of demos, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which I had purchased for play on my PS3 a long while ago.

Like the bar scene - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbl2LxNZ2eY - in Sin City and near the end of Avalon - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P28-PPzCI3k - and the obvious ones in the Wizard of Oz. Any other good examples? Response from Rob Lumley You seem to be mentioning when a particular color stands out.

                                In a previous article, I had outlined&nbsp;classes in C# and PHP to handle&nbsp;iTunes Playlists to Xml outputs. Having let it sit on the back burner for long enough, I finally went back to the PHP class and finalized the constructor. I also added two functions for sorting. Below I have the current code for the class (a current version of the Track class for PHP will always be available elsewhere) and then an example implementation.

                                I've recently begun reading up on PHP again. As I'm most fond of my iTunes Playlists to Xml application, I thought I'd work with that application's output - XML files with playlist data - as I continued to dig into PHP (instead of stopping now that I know enough to tweak existing code and create new functionality). Here's a basic Track object in C# and PHP. I'll of course be elaborating on these as time goes by (and already have code for the C# implementation).

I've converted it from an ODS file to XML, and am making it available. Shadow Hearts: Covenant leveling guide. Since I have a leveling guide for Shadow Hearts: From the New World&nbsp;(previously written about), it almost makes sense to go back and play the original Shadow Hearts to get information for that game as well.

                                Laying aside the question of whether these are merely in response to the amount of money being made by the Wii, and whether the technology will be as lasting as history suggests 3D televisions will be, I've been thinking about the Kinect and Move recently. Here are my thoughts. How well will they work? This is the biggest question. Ever since they were first shown on television there's been the question of what environments will support the Kinect.

                                As I prepare to create another XML data file, I started looking at the standards I use to create XML files, and what the recommendations are. Elements In the past I've used camel case, but on a recent file used Pascal case instead. I think this was more becauase I've started to using Pascal case for public items (variables), and camel case for private items, as that's fairly standard in development.

After first, rightly, attacking Apple's iTunes and iPod (and related) platforms as being slow and unwieldy, especially on the predominate operating system Windows (not even mentioning Linux), and overall behind on the times, Farhad moves us from syncing our music collections out to the cloud.

                                After receiving my instant streaming disc for the Wii a long while back, I finally popped it in my Wii and gave it a try. For this experiment I watched three episodes of 30 Rock: Season 1. I wasn't expecting much for quality, and each episode isn't very long, so I thought I was giving the Wii a very good chance. Overall, I was extremely impressed in the entire experience, and definitely think Nintendo's own video channels can learn a lot.

                                While Web application development is just as complex as other application development, if not more so, it&rsquo;s fairly difficult to find information on best practices while doing Web development. In order to move towards implementation of Subversion, I needed to write up documentation on how we&rsquo;d use it. After a couple drafts, which I ended up scrapping almost completely, I came up with the below. In the interest of sharing, I&rsquo;ve included the full document below, after removing the few instances where I had to specify a non-Subversion application (our help desk application).

                                Previously posted on Facebook: 80's Linda Hamilton; sure, she did T2 in the 90s, but I bet if you think Linda Hamilton, you think 80s. Am I wrong? Rob Lumley brings up Terminator 2 as being his reason he'd go with 90s Hamilton. I'd agree with you on the Terminator franchise, but, obviously, not with Hamilton being better in the 90s solely because of T2. Look at IMDb - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/ TV, movies, TV, movie (T2), and then back to TV, never to return to movies (meaning non-direct to VHS/DVD).

                                I purchased an HP Pavilion a6360t with Windows Vista Home&nbsp;Premium&nbsp;and later upgraded it (due to a conference) for free to Windows Vista Ultimate, and then added a second hard drive. What would happen when I upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium? Could I use the 64-bit version? The answer to these questions is, due to testing, below: Windows 7 Upgrading, doing a custom/clean install on my primary drive required approximately 38 minutes.

                                There may be an easier way to do this in ColdFusion, but I finally created a function to determine whether a variable exists and if it does, returns in, all html-escaped. &lt;cfscript&gt; // Checks the passed CF variable to see if it exists, and if it does, outputs a trimmed and html-ready version of the value. function checkForValueOutput(data) { if (IsDefined(data)) { return HtmlEditFormat(Trim(Evaluate(data))); } else { return ""; } } &lt;/cfscript&gt; (Obviously, this can rather easily be converted to a function.) This results in a change from: &lt;input type="text" id="someField" name="someField"&nbsp;value="&lt;cfif IsDefined("FORM.someField") AND Trim(FORM.someField) NEQ ""&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#HtmlEncodedFormat(Trim(FORM.someField))#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/cfif&gt;" /&gt; To: &lt;input type="text" id="someField" name="someField"&nbsp;value="&lt;cfoutput&gt;#checkForValueOutput("FORM.someField")#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;" /&gt; Much easier to read, and much shorter.

                                Recently I purchased another HP Pocket Media Drive, with 500 GB of space (instead of the 160 GB drives I had purchased before). Since I'd like to plan out my backup strategy, and need to backup for my upcoming Windows 7 install (which since I have Vista Ultimate, will require a deal of work), I decided to write this post. My computer's setup Currently I have a primary 450 GB hard drive (advertised as 500 GB) and a 700 GB secondary drive that I put in (advertised as 750 GB).

                                Similar to my post on parsing Last.fm's artist.getSimilar, I've been working with Yahoo! Music's Web services today. Unfortunately, Yahoo!'s services aren't quite as friendly as those made available by Last.fm. So that I remember, and others don't have to tackle this as well, here's the class I've created.

                                I would be willing to bet that at least 90% of the time when someone uses the phrase "I can't wait" they're lying. What made me realize this is when I read a comment the other day regarding a video game's review. In this comment the individual had basically stated that they couldn't wait for the game. At the time of their comment, however, the game was already in stores and available for purchase.

                                The following covers how to parse the XML response of artist.getSimilar, from Last.fm's Web Services. Setup and assumptions The first step is sign up for a free API account at Last.fm. You'll also need to target .NET Framework 3.5 when you setup your project, so as to access LINQ functionality. When writing the steps listed below, I was working on a Windows Forms Application, but the steps should be the same, or very similar, for other project types.

                                I owe a deal of thanks for figuring out the Muenchian Method of grouping in XSLT (1.0) to Jeni's article Grouping Using the Muenchian Method. It took, however, a while for me to get my mind around the method completely, and some experimentation, which I'm sharing below. Specifically I was looking to get a listing of tracks, from my iTunes Playlists to Xml application's output, and group them by album. For this, all I really need is the track's album and name, which gives a basic layout of the following.

                                There's a difference between self control and killing something off. Self control is when you hunger for something, but say no. Killing something off is when you no longer hunger for something. The former is a near-constant struggle, depending upon how often the hunger makes itself known, while the latter is, once the desire is killed, relatively easy, except perhaps during moments of rememberence. Trying to remember what it was like to have a hunger/desire of a particular sort, can be, at times, more painful than the desire itself.

                                Granted, in the case where this came up, I should have moved away from a SqlDataSource, but I wrote it using one, and a re-write isn't possible at the moment. So, I had to find a way yesterday to programmatically set the command timeout of a select, using a SqlDataSource (that was programmatically written). After much research, I found that you have to set the timeout on selecting. After opening a dummy document to see if I could determine how it was normally done, I came up with something like the following: SqlDataSource dataSource = new SqlDataSource(); // code removed dataSource.Selecting += GenericSelecting; // code removed The GenericSelecting is as follows: protected void GenericSelecting(object sender, SqlDataSourceSelectingEventArgs e) { e.Command.CommandTimeout = 6000; } Excessive timeout, yes, but it works.

                                In a similar article I detailed how I was doing programmatic access of Microsoft SQL Server. However, on another project I was creating a class in App_Code. Using my method required the use of a couple additional namespaces from System.Web. That seemed a bit excessive. So I did some digging around and came up with what I believe is a better solution, for use in classes/non-Web code. First, the following must be included in.

                                I keep having to search through code to find it, so, since writing about it makes it easier for me to find ... here's how I've been programmatically making calls to Microsoft SQL Server. If I'm doing something wrong, please comment below or send me an email. Some times have been changed to dummy values. SqlDataSource dataSource = new SqlDataSource(); dataSource.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString; dataSource.SelectCommand = "stored_proc"; dataSource.SelectCommandType = SqlDataSourceCommandType.StoredProcedure; dataSource.SelectParameters.Add("id", value); dataSource.CacheDuration = 3600; DataView viewData = (DataView)dataSource.Select(DataSourceSelectArguments.Empty); DataTable tableData = viewData.ToTable(); //Stuff tableData = null; viewData = null; dataSource = null; From what I can tell, there's no close by doing a select this way; the connection must close after it's performed?

                                To a very large extent, I consider myself to be a gamer. Around the time the NES came out, my family picked up an Atari 2600, used. I don't know who sold it to us, but I can remember going with my dad to pick it up at my school's playground (that was the meeting place). At a later point we picked up an NES, via my dad, and then my mom bought us a SNES.

                                The following is how I went about performing an upgrade of Subversion 1.5.4 to Subversion 1.6.0. For this I'll be continuing to use the current Windows build of Apache 2.2.x, TortoiseSVN, and of course Subversion. At this time, that's Subversion 1.6.0, TortoiseSVN 1.6.0, and Apache 2.2.11. Determine current setup. Opening the Apache Service Monitor will show the version of Apache and Subversion. In my case, that's 2.2.10 and 1.5.4, respectively. Opening TortoiseSVN's menu and selecting About will display the current version.

It happened one day, having began a work &quot;upon the religious metaphysics of the ancients,&quot; which was &quot;not good for&quot; &quot;the Christian mind.&quot; Having gone far out of the way to read a collection of particular volumes, he finds himself in an omnibus late at night.

                                Since I know I&#39;ll run across this again ... In my iTunes Playlists to Xml application I wanted to allow users the ability to persist their name across sessions. The supported method seems to be using application configuration files; in my case, something like iTunesApplication.exe.config. However, try as I could, I just couldn&#39;t find anything solid on how to create the configuration file. First, I had to add a reference to &quot;System.configuration&quot; (in References).

                                Mr. Bruce Springsteen, While I can&#39;t remember the exact date, or even the year, it was shortly after my parents had divorced, and my father moved out into the country, that I first listened to Born in the U.S.A.; it was one of my father&#39;s old tapes. Now, I really wonder that I didn&#39;t wear that old tape out. I was pre-teen, and living in northern Wisconsin, and raised Catholic,&nbsp;so not all of the lyrics made sense (not that I really thought about them all that much outside of remembering the exact order, so I could sing the songs by heart), so in that sense, I certainly was lacking an understanding of what they really meant.

                                To some extent, the game Battleship is fairly out of date. With today&#39;s technology, are we really calling attacks on individual areas at a time? For this reason, I put forward the following attack additions. Requirements are for the player using these attacks. Tactical Strike Requires an&nbsp;undamaged submarine. Give up one turn. If, on the next turn, your submarine is still unharmed, attack a 3x3 grid on the opposing player. Can only be used once per game.

Here&#39;s what I currently track: Artist CD Name Date bought Place bought Bought price Number of songs Time (which I don&#39;t fill in very often) Misc info/notes Following the iTunes standard, each CD has a main artist. Songs, which could be listed (and which I listed back when I had this in Access, I did so), could have their own artists.

                                While FileZilla Server is one of the best FTP servers available, it&#39;s logging leaves much to be desired. However, after a couple of hours, I&#39;ve created a script for Log Parser that will generate a W3C log from FileZilla Server&#39;s logs. Save the following to a file, for example, FileZillaServer.sql: SELECT &nbsp;SUBSTR(Text, 1, SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 1)) AS RequestNumber &nbsp;, TO_TIMESTAMP( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 4)) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;M/d/yyyy?H:mm:ss&#39; &nbsp;) AS DateTime &nbsp;--, TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;, TRIM(SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;, 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;, LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;)) AS User &nbsp;, SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;, ADD(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;, SUB(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;)&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), ADD(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), 1)) &nbsp;) AS IpAddress &nbsp;, SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), 2), SUB(STRLEN(Text), INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;))) AS Request INTO FileZilla.log FROM fzs-*.log WHERE Text LIKE &#39;(%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;Connected,%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;221 %&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;disconnected%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;QUIT%&#39; Items in bold can be easily changed.

                                After playing around with settings, I was finally able to access my wireless network with my HP iPAQ 110. Here&#39;s what I did. Under Wireless &gt; Wireless Security, set the model to WEP, setting a passphrase and generating keys. Make sure your wireless is enabled. Once the network shows in your iPAQ, set the Authentication to Shared and the Data Encryption to WEP. Select the key index and enter the key equal to the Default Transmit Key from the WRT54G.

This will by no means make up for a reading of the book&nbsp;- Essential C# 3.0: For .NET Framework 3.5 (2nd Edition). (Link to my review will be posted once I finish the book.) I work primarily on the Web, so that will be my main focus from reading this book. Some chapters may not be present here, depending upon what I think is note-worthy at the time.

                                We've been running into an issue, off and on, with ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 having issues with Verity collections. During one of our nightly jobs, two Verity collections are purged, through ColdFusion, and then re-built.&nbsp; Sometimes this will bring the collection down, resulting in a message like the following. Collection down after opening (10) Using the mdvdk executable, you can get some information about the collection, and even bring it back up.

                                This article is meant to hold some of the thoughts that I've been having about allowing a user to control the layout of a page, in particular for use within a content management system (CMS). The system would need to be able to support a user creating templates easily, but hopefully without the use of tables. In the CSS Advanced Layout Module, there is a draft specification for Template-based positioning. This uses @, .

                                This article contains my own opinionated opinion only. Why do most crime dramas take place in New York? Why does New York, along with Hollywood, think that they are the center of the United States? Of all the states and cities, New York is probably the most ego-centric, after all, how many cities share the name of the state that they are in? (Low-blow.) What follows is more questions, than answers, that stem from my thoughts on New York.

                                Pre-emptive clarifications First, by a &lsquo;good man&rsquo; we specifically mean here one who is truly good. By &lsquo;good&rsquo; we mean one who, by their actions, attempts to decrease the amount of evil. By &lsquo;evil&rsquo; we mean those actions which are disruptive towards a social, unified, ordered, society. For example, murder, theft and&nbsp;pillaging. This by no means exhausts all potential issues with the below, but if one assumes the common definitions, it should make sense.

                                I purchased a Casio EX-Z1200 a bit ago, which I&#39;ve been playing around with. Overall, I&#39;ve been very happy with it, however, it outputs movies to the MOV format. While this seemed great for Apple, it wasn&#39;t the best for me. After testing out QuickTime Pro (7. something) and Ulead Movie Wizard 3.2 SE VCD (which came with the camera), I was about to settle for less than I hoped for.

                                Ramblings at this point. I probably won&#39;t clean them up, but I might.&nbsp; Ars technica has a post, Microsoft patent could force downloaders to view commercials, regarding advertising before the playing and/or downloading of online content. Microsoft&#39;s patent application, titled Enforcing Advertising Playback For Downloaded Media Content, describes systems that are based both on tokens and DRM which would prohibit playing a media file unless its accompanying advertising is viewed. The technology is designed to prohibit fast-forwarding, editing, or otherwise circumventing the advertisements, though it is unclear exactly where the ads would be placed.&nbsp; Now I have a couple of experiences with online video, and can therefore give my opinion on this.

                                The following are notes on the Preface of the second edition of Immanuel Kant&#39;s Critique of Pure Reason. For the month of December 2007, I&#39;ll be reading the Critique and writing notes as I go. For all citations, I am using the edition published by Palgrave Macmillan (ISBN 1-4039-1195-9), and translated by Norman Kemp Smith. The following article covers pages 17 to 37 of this edition. There&#39;s quite a difference from the first edition&#39;s Preface to the second&#39;s.

                                While I initially hooked up my Playstation 3 a week ago, when I was posting to the official PS forums today, my second post, I was doing so to recommend a version of the router I&#39;m using. Since both items are pretty popular now, it makes sense to write up a quick guide on them, I suppose. My equipment First off, there&#39;s my setup. I&#39;ve had pretty experiences with Linksys, but poor experiences with Netgear, so Linksys I am.

                                In the beginning of this month, I purchased a 32" Sony Bravia. In the two weeks that I've had the television, I've run into a couple of things that I would like the television to offer. In no particular order, they are listed below. Better volume detection Maybe it's because the speakers are better on this tv than my old one, but there's definitely an issue with commercial versus programming volumes.

                                In this world, there&#39;s a number of people who get paid for playing video games. I am not one of those people. This is a good reason to trust the people, with a grain of salt, when it&nbsp;comes to said video games. Recently, I&#39;ve been trying to decide between an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3, for my next-gen console, since we all know that the Wii isn&#39;t next-gen. It weren&#39;t for co-workers, my mind would already be made up.

                                Recently, Gavin Schmitt asked me what my thoughts were on philosophy books about philosophers. Does that ever bother you, by the way? Philosophy books about other philosophers? Either you read it ahead of time and you don&#39;t know what the hell the author is talking about, or you read it afterwards and you end up not recalling the exact passages the author is referring to. It&#39;s like you need a FIRM grasp on the material to appreciate a book on the philosopher, but if you have that firm grasp you probably don&#39;t need to read the book (besides as a refresher).

                                Today I purchased a new television, to replace my tried-and-true Philips 20&quot;. After a couple of months of research, and etcetera, I decided to go with a Sony Bravia. Since my previous television was a 20&quot;, purchased back during my sophmore or junior year of college, and still using &#39;tube&#39; technology, I figured it was time to upgrade, especially since I&#39;ve been watching more movies via Netflix, and am planning on purchasing one of the current next-gen video game systems (P3 or 360).

                                In January and March of 2005, I asked Gavin Schmitt, of The Framing Business and Gavin War Journal, a number of questions. Those questions, and the respective answers, have been posted below. Since his answers may have changed since early 2005, I&#39;ll be adding any additional comments he may have to the answers below. 1) I&#39;m about to read your writings - why should I? In all honesty, you probably shouldn&#39;t.

                                In 2003, I received a bachelor&#39;s in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin: Green Bay. During my four and a half years at Green Bay, I studied a deal of philosophy, without ever really deciding that I&#39;d go for a degree in philosophy; philosophy was actually meant to just satisfy the necessary requirement of picking a degree in my sophmore year. Nonetheless, gradate with philosophy I did. During those years, I studied a number of philosophers, some more than others.

                                In IIS 6.0, you can setup Application Pools for each of your sites. My knowledge of the exact benefits of this is somewhat lacking, but what I do understand is that these help applications (Web sites) stay within their own bounds, and prevent them from having a bad effect upon each other. For example, if one application is preforming poorly, as long as it&#39;s not a server-wide issue, the other sites on the server will be impacted minimally.

                                The following are merely notes that will eventually be expanded upon in a longer article. For most of us, from our earliest days we are taught that one day we will become an adult, get married, and have children. Depending upon where you grow up, what your parents think of higher education, and what their thoughts are regarding said education, going to college may also be a part of the prescribed future.

                                Question: Is my detached hand me? Id est, if someone were to cut my hand off and place it on a table, could one say that that hand is me (James Skemp)? I reply: A part of me, yes. But, so too is the rest of my, otherwise whole, body. So, saying &quot;this is x,&quot; where &#39;this&#39; refers to a part of &#39;x,&#39; no matter what the part, is the same, in some sense, of saying that of any other part.

                                The following quotes are from movies. At the moment, it&#39;s just the two, but, more shall surely come. Look. The supermodel&#39;s a beautiful girl, Will. She can make you dizzy, like you&#39;ve been drinking Jack all morning. She can make you feel high for the greatest commodity known to man - promise, the promise of a better day, the promise of a greater hope, the promise of a new tomorrow. This particular ore can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl - in her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing about life seem OK.

                                I&#39;ve been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since I first listened to the album Born in the USA (on cassette), way back, many, many years ago. Most of the music/songs that I enjoy are because of women, but Bruce Springsteen is one of the few artists that I enjoy because of a man. In this case, my father had the tape, but it was women who gave the music true meaning.&nbsp; Anywho ...

                                Harlan Ellison is one of those authors who not only writes interesting things, but is also quite an interesting character himself (like Chuck Palahniuk, and Philip K. Dick). One of Ellison&#39;s major themes is love. He&#39;s written a good deal about it, and while I&#39;m doing my research on love, I couldn&#39;t exclude Ellison. What follows are quotes from Ellison&#39;s pieces that reference that thing called love ... On the night that he actually paid for love, the night he physically reached into his wallet and took out two ten dollar bills and gave them to the girl, the creature took full and final shape.

                                A few weeks ago, I believe, a coworker and I were talking about Google, in particular, how he happens to search for people, he once knew, online. Of course, I don&#39;t think I know anyone who hasn&#39;t at least done this once (even if that individual they searched for happened to be themselves). The question is, is it true that, if someone can&#39;t find a record of you online, that you&#39;re dead?

All code from a terminal, unless otherwise noted. sudo apt-get install build-essential cd mkdir src cd src I downloaded zlib from http://www.zlib.net/ (zlib source code, version 1.2.3, tar.gz format) into the src folder, and extracted it to the same. cd zlib-1.2.3/ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local make sudo make install At http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi, I downloaded Unix Source: httpd-2.2.4.tar.gz, saved it to the src directory, and extracted it to the same.

Logically speaking, the rule of Double Negation tells us that p :: ~~p. In order words, if something is blue, it is not not blue. Unfortunately, this is one of the <a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Rules-for-Sentential-Logic.aspx">rules for sentential logic</a> that is philosophically troubling.</p>

    &ldquo;These wars, famines, floods and quakes meet well-defined needs. Man wants chaos. In fact, he&rsquo;s gotta have it. Depression, strife, riots, murder, all this dread. We&rsquo;re irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction. It&rsquo;s in all of us. We revel in it. Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things, painting them up as great human tragedies. But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world, no. Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them. The powers that be want us to be passive observers.&rdquo; - <cite><a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/05/25/91/waking-life-chapter-4-alienation/">Waking Life</a></cite>

Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t kept up all that much with the recent (April 17, 2007) shootings in Virginia. However, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard a disturbing trend, namely the dehumanizing and ostracizing of the shooter, Cho Seung-Hui. Quite frankly, this is disturbing.

I frequently find myself in an argument that to many appears to be one of splitting hairs. That is the discussion of atheism, that I am atheist, not AN atheist.

In February 2006, I wrote an <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/02/16/45/installing-apache-to-a-windows-based-computer-locally/">article covering the installation of Apache 1.3.34</a>, which can be found on my site, StrivingLife.net. In August 2006, I covered <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/08/22/198/installing-apache-2059-to-a-windows-based-computer-locally-part-1/">the installation of Apache 2.0.59</a>. This time, I&#39;ll be covering the installation of the current version of Apache 2.2.x, Apache 2.2.4, to a Windows XP machine, for the purpose of local development.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;ll be covering an installation of Apache 2.2.4 that will work along with Apache 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x, this guide will work equally well if you&#39;re installing Apache 2.2.x by itself.

                                Near the top of one of the sections in the POV-Ray&trade; 3.5 manual there is a quote about wishing that past mathematical formulas were remembered, or something to that effect. I too wish I had remembered what I had learned in some of my past math classes, but after a bit of research, I have begun to work on some of the information that I have forgotten. Here is one of those areas.

When it comes to proper coding, you should know the most important rule of all; LIFO. However, not even LIFO nor the W3C can really tell you which order to put certain elements. In the nature of Web 2.0, I&#39;ll discuss some of the standards I&#39;ve been bouncing around for HTML text markup when the same text is given multiple attributes.

Just for purchasing a discount card at a local video store (GameStop), I not only got a year of 10% off video games, I also picked up a free one-year subscription to <cite>Game Informer</cite>.  Not too bad for $15.  In this month&#39;s issue, Issue 157 (May 2006), there&#39;s a page of debate (yes and no) to the question of whether or not in-game advertising really hurts video games.  In this post, I&#39;ll be looking at the two responses, as well as crafting my own response to this question.</p>

Quite a while ago - back in May of 2003 actually - I began work on a guide that would display every possible number combination for cross sum puzzles. Since then, a number of people have corrected mistakes that crept in, resulting in a number of different versions of the guide over the last (almost) two years.</p>

<p>Notes: Text comes from the source listed below. Highlighting is my own, as well as any indented text. The best way to use this document is to either read a copy reprinted elsewhere and then to read over this, to read the entire (non-indented) text here, with particular note of the highlighted areas, or to read this entire document, from top to bottom. The notes that I supply follow immediately after a paragraph and discuss/clarify the above paragraph. The highlighting is meant to draw attention to particular words, as I feel this is where the most importance lies.</p>

While I believe there was a story regarding the first two, I can&#39;t seem to find it (I&#39;m posting these on September 2, 2007, so quite some time has gone by since thinking these up) ... Delicious Nutritious D&eacute;j&agrave; vu Child Peace Pipe The third seems too much like an album by Sir Paul, to be of much good these days ...

                                To: All Staff From: Institutional Technology and Services (ITS) It has come to our attention that a number of staff members are using so-called &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; passwords. A &lsquo;secure&rsquo; password is typically defined as a password with a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters, like spaces ( ), periods (.), and punctuation marks (like &lsquo;!&rsquo; and &lsquo;?&rsquo;). An &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; password, on the other hand, is typically defined as an easily guessed word, like &lsquo;password&rsquo;, &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;help&rsquo;, various other four letter words, and the ever popular &lsquo;god&rsquo;.

Back when I was in college, I can recall talking to one Ms. Tessa Gruszynski regarding how, basically, I was going to stop caring about, or being kind to, strangers. I believe the particular item was holding open doors for people who would make no gesture of thanks.

                                ***CONFIDENTIAL*** ***FOR TEAM LEADERSHIP ONLY*** ***PLEASE SHRED IF FOUND*** It&rsquo;s come to my attention that a number of team players have been taking full sixty minute lunch breaks in the past couple of weeks. As I&rsquo;m sure you all recall from our last outing in late April, most of our team players had been taking anywhere between thirty and fifty minute lunch breaks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite surprising, with these figures in mind, that our team players are now taking sixty minute breaks.&nbsp; I wonder why it is that this is now occurring.&nbsp; Can someone clarify for me why, not even two months later, we&rsquo;re seeing this change?

I was sceptical whether my machine, a HP Pavilion a620n, with standard specifications, could play Unreal Tournament 2004. Since I had a couple of hours to kill, late one night, I decided I would try downloading the demo, to see if it would run on my machine. I had previously downloaded the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo as well, to also see if I could get that to run, and had bought the Unreal Tournament, Game of the Year Edition, for an older computer. To make a long opening short, this guide is going to go over Unreal Tournament and the HP Pavilion a620n, with standard specifications (id est, no altercations). If you&#39;re using this computer, and would like to use one of these programs, I&#39;m going to tell you if you can.

This way, our users would be completely entertained while waiting for their search results.

While reading a past news item regarding the <a href="http://www.wisbar.org/divisions/yld/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Young Lawyers Division of the State Bar of Wisconsin</a>, I asked myself if donating was equal to volunteering. The Young Lawyers Division (YLD) collects business clothing from lawyers to give to lawyers who cannot afford business clothing. If lawyer X donates clothing to the YLD, is lawyer X volunteering? To get to the answer to this question, I have to proof that volunteering implies, or suggests, donating, and that donating implies volunteering. If either is not the case, or if both are not the case, then volunteering is not the same as donating.</p>

On a cold sunny day in March, little Billy Ann and little Bobby Jo happened upon a street. Billy Ann and Bobby Jo had happened upon this street before, but never on a Sunday, and never when alone. Of course, they had each other, and that is truly what usually matters. Yet our story does not end like this, for Billy Ann and Bobby Jo were about to cross the line and be the little naughty children that every child dreads that they will one day become.

Back on the second of February 2002, I first, as far as I can recall or prove, wrote down the question &ldquo;Is it better to live a lie, or know the truth and cry?&rdquo; The item that this was written in was an item called <em>Guide to One Philosophy of Life: Revision 1</em>, and consisted of twelve pages of material from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002. While I kept saying that I was going to get back to it and revise it, I never did.
</p>
<p>
A recent item on a LiveJournal journal, along with something I had read earlier in the day on the same area, reminded me of this quote that I had written so long ago. After some searching, I found it in the item mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
My task here is to discuss this question that I have raised. Of course, it being April 27 2005, I should point out that I do not have an answer to this question as of yet. Perhaps that suggests that I am doing more of the former than the latter, or perhaps it is because the latter has gotten me no closer to the answer of this question.

There is an old saying that says something to the effect of &ldquo;if you try hard enough, you can become anything, even president&rdquo; (the President of the United States is usually implied, but the general idea is the ruler of a country/government). I was thinking one day that there must be certain states in which certain individuals have little chance of actually becoming President of the United States, so I undertook to find out what states Presidents have come from, and look at what states Presidents have not come from.

Learning a program can be quite fun and rewarding, but can also be somewhat disarming. While there were a number of guides on the Internet that discussed <a href="http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/">Fractal Explorer</a>, I felt that none of them did any great service to this great program. So, I set out to create my own guide, in a format that did not force a user to view only a small amount of information at a time.

In Frank Stockton&rsquo;s 1882 piece <em>The Lady or the Tiger</em>, Stockton asks us to determine the ending of the story. While one thinks they have enough information to make an informed decision and come to the correct answer, they in fact do not. His later piece, <em>The Discourager of Hesitancy</em>, also continues this tradition. Of course, Stockton is not the only writer to use this method to capture an audience. However, Stockton is one of the few to take this method to such a level. For this article I&rsquo;ll be discussing Stockton&rsquo;s pieces, as well as other cases of this in the media, including Tarantino&rsquo;s movie <cite><a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Pulp-Fiction-A-Timeline-of-the-Events-of-the-Movie.aspx">Pulp Fiction</a></cite>.

                                A while ago, I wrote an article regarding InboxDollars.com (also known as, InboxDollar$.com). That article, On InboxDollar$.com, and similar programs, discussed some of the good things about this site and it&rsquo;s program. However, I feel as though some additional information could be given. Specifically, I feel as though people are afraid to enter into these kinds of sites for a couple of reasons, which I detail, and hopefully dispel, below. First, people hesitate giving out their email in general, at least after having been spammed by a number of sources.

If you&rsquo;re going to read more on Arthur Schopenhauer, I suggest you start with his main works, followed by other primary resources (id est, books written by him), followed by secondary resources. 
</p>
<p>
For ease, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of books currently available to the English language reader. Obviously, if you can read German, it makes little sense to purchase any of the translations, since the language the work was written in is better suited for Schopenhauer&rsquo;s original thoughts.

                                Linking to documents that are found online is almost always a troublesome issue. Unlike print documents, that one could purchase online, read in the library, or read in a bookstore &ndash; for those that don&rsquo;t like to purchase books &ndash; online documents are fairly fluid. This is because one major reason, as well as a few other reasons. This article will discuss that main reason, as well as whether it&rsquo;s beneficial to link to documents online, and if it is, how to best do it.

                                First it was Afghanistan. Next, it was Iraq, Iran and North Korea, parts of the &lsquo;axis of evil&rsquo;. Now Condoleezza Rice is calling our attention to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Burma and Belarus (Belarus? Is anyone else wondering where this is? And I keep myself fairly up to date on these things, I thought.). Gavin introduced me to Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s spoken word, so I understand why Cuba would be a threat to the United States.

                                Something has been on my mind for a number of months as of late regarding stoplights and cars. People tend to, and perhaps naturally, speed, and my article regarding speed limits (On the Speed Limit) is fairly popular because of it. However, people also tend to not stop for yellow lights, and sometimes even for red lights, but would much rather drive through them. This raised the question of whether it really is best to be the last one through a stoplight (speed up while the light is yellow), or if it makes more sense to not &lsquo;run&rsquo; the light, and instead be the very first one in &lsquo;line&rsquo; at the light.

                                Somewhat major news is the fact that Blockbuster&trade;, the popular video and game rental store, is ending late fees. While it&rsquo;s certainly interesting news, reading up on this you&rsquo;ll find that Blockbuster&trade; hasn&rsquo;t really ended late fees, rather they have changed them in order to make more money[1]. For those of us new to late fees, these are basically fees imposed by a rental agency for not returning the rented items by the due date.

                                The average computer user is not an IT (Information Technology) professional. That said, the average computer user, computer users below average (especially), and many above average computer users, will end up with some kind of computer related problem at least once while using computers. There are a great number of reasons why this will occur, but for the most part it is because there are a number of programs out there that attempt to use computers for a specific purpose, while ignoring the desires of the computer&rsquo;s user.

After the 2004 election, where Bush won by allowing the American public to live their lives in fear (see my own <em>On the Saying &ldquo;Terrorists Will Put Bush in Office&rdquo;</em>), I decided to look at the voting record of Wisconsin, whether they could pick a President, or not.

(MP3 format) If you&rsquo;re like me, and I&rsquo;ll be assuming that you are during this article, then you&rsquo;ve probably seen a lot more use of &lsquo;clown shoes&rsquo; on the Internet. For whatever reason, this is not occurring simply on sites in the industry of &lsquo;all things clown&rsquo;, but is also occurring on some of the larger, and more popular, web communities.

                                Looking through an old philosophy anthology, Biomedical Ethics: Fifth Edition, I found and read On Lying to Patients, by Mack Lipkin. After reading this piece, I was again made to realize how much I dislike ethics. While Lipkin sets out to give us a theory, or method, he leaves us with more questions than answers. For this article, I would like to discuss whether doctors have an ethical obligation to tell the truth to their patients.

                                So I had seen the 10th Anniversary DVD Edition of Myst before the holiday rush, and was planning on making a purchase when I thought things would settle down a little bit.&nbsp;I also wanted to pick up a couple of copies of The Beatles, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure which CDs (until I heard Norwegian Wood on the radio on the way &ndash; more about this and my interest in The Beatles in another article).&nbsp;However, this most recent experience was absolutely horrid (as I said in my online survey, perhaps a harsh word, but it may just be necessary), and required that I write some general thoughts I had regarding Best Buy, and similar stores/experiences at such stores.&nbsp;Note that while I specifically reference Best Buy, many of these comments can be applied to stores of a similar nature and should be construed as such.

However, since it is a saying that I have heard many a time, and since I wanted to try to understand where this statement may have originated, I decided to try to work through its significance.

                                I was at work, doing work, when I suddenly realized that the story of the fall really does have some importance, outside of the religions that teach it. The story of the fall is the story of Eve and Adam dining on the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or wisdom. I&rsquo;d like to discuss here what I have found to be the true significance of this story. First, there are a few major items, or things, that need to be discussed in any discussion of this story.

                                Checking my referrers, I often ran across the phrase &lsquo;Richard Skemp&rsquo; (sometimes with initial caps, often without). Since I like to be able to help people, I figured I would take a look at whom this individual is. The following is what I was able to learn from my foray into the information online. Mathematics is a necessary tool in everyday life. One of the problems, however, that I often find myself thinking about, is how you teach someone math.

Google it if you&#39;d like to see it for yourself (or just browse Something Awful), or read on. One of the easiest kinds of humour is the kind at the expense of another. Honestly, it&#39;s funny to see someone suffer some kind of hardship or accident.

                                Notes: While primarily based upon The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and Its Discontents may have crept into this discussion. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, seeing as how the latter is a sequel of the former, but if you have not read the latter, some of the ideas here may be new to you. Sigmund Freud tells us, near the end of the work, that &ldquo;the sole purpose&rdquo; of The Future of an Illusion is point out the necessity of man surmounting infantilism.

                                Listen to On the Saying &#39;God is Odd&#39; (MP3 format). An old and popular saying states that &lsquo;God is odd&rsquo;. But is there any validity to this claim? This article shows that there is indeed validity and truth to this claim. God consists, or is equal to the addition, of three characters; &lsquo;G&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, and &lsquo;d&rsquo;. If a number is not evenly divisible by two, that number is odd. Three divided by two is one-and-one-half, therefore three is not evenly divisible by two.

                                Ren&eacute; Descartes&rsquo; Meditations on First Philosophy consists of three parts; a preface to the reader, a synopsis, and the six mediations themselves.&nbsp; Heralded as the first &lsquo;modern&rsquo; thinker in philosophy, Descartes introduces the problem encompassed by &lsquo;dualism&rsquo;: how is it that mind and body can interact with each other?&nbsp; Descartes also questions how it is that we can know reality.&nbsp; While the quick answer is through our senses, depending upon our senses opens us up to questions of how we know that our senses are correct.

                                The reason most people foresee George W. Bush taking the presidency in the 2004 election is because most people believe Bush has the best chance protecting America from terrorists, compared with John Kerry.&nbsp; The question is, what does this mean? Put bluntly, this means that despite Bush&rsquo;s record from 2000 to the present, fear will put Bush in the Oval Office for another 4 years &ndash; fear brought on by an arbitrary colour system &ndash; fear of a people on the other side of the world, attacking us because we believe in freedom, or so they say.

Gandhi was convinced much of the violence in society and in our personal lives stems from the passive violence that we commit against each other. He described these acts of passive violence as the &quot;Seven Blunders.&quot; Grandfather gave me the list in 1947 just before we left India to return to South Africa where my father, Manilal, Gandhi&#39;s second son, and my mother, Sushila, worked for nonviolent change.

                                <p>
The reason I picked up Martin Heidegger&#39;s <cite>The Principle of Reason</cite> was quite simple - having read Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <cite>The World as Will and Representation</cite> and agreed with many of his points, I attempt to further my knowledge of his principles as much as possible. While Heidegger doesn&#39;t mention Schopenhauer a single time in his thirteen Lectures, nor in his Address, Schopenhauer certainly discusses the Principle of Reason, pulling off of Leibniz, and is therefore a blatant oversight of Heidegger&#39;s to not mention Schopenhauer at all. Whether this is unintentional one cannot know from simply the text, but for a German philosopher to not know another German philosopher who covered the same content is quite surprising, to say the very least.

                                Rest. Passivity. Inactivity. All speak of the absence of movement &ndash; the absence of activity &ndash; in common language. Yet, when I stand still is it really very different than when I am moving about? Is inactivity really the absence of activity? Let us say I am walking down the street. I see a beautiful manikin in a storefront window with short, shoulder length, red hair. While it is true that I am no longer in motion &ndash; I no longer advance down the street, I still made a choice to stop at the particular storefront window and look in.

The following is meant to be an overview of <em>The Principles of Philosophy</em>, or, the<em> Monadology</em> (1714), by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). My main interest in Leibniz is to see how his work relates to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. Any notes that I make should be read with this in mind.

                                Listen to On Karate (MP3 format). The best thing about Karate is that you can be walking down the street with someone and they can bust a Karate Move&trade; just like that. Karate, pronounced care-aht-tay, is more than just a way of life; it&rsquo;s also a way of being and living. On a scale from one to ten, it&rsquo;s ten times God. One time I was walking down the street with my friend and he was like &lsquo;Woah!

                                The Internet consists of a couple different kinds of sites. In the first place, we have educational sites, such as universities, libraries, and working groups. We also have business sites, which include sites that sell products online, as well as those that offer technical support through their site. Personal sites, another category, take up another chunk of the Internet. Personal sites can vary between a journal of an individual, to a compilation of multiple individuals (either in design or content).

I, having read contrary statements in articles that you had previously written, felt that the very least I could was point out said statements to this individual, as well as suggest to them that they contact you directly regarding said statements.

                                I must admit that Robert Heilbroner&#39;s An Inquiry Into the Human Prospect was not quite the book that I thought it was going to be. The title and cover were what drew me to the book, and the back cover information had little impact, if any, because I realized after reading the book that I may not have read it... Of course, Heilbroner refers to Hobbes at least once, and Marx quite a few times, and since these two are political philosophers, and since philosophy runs through everything, I wasn&#39;t displeased with the book in the least.

                                <p>
Let&#39;s assume, firstly, that you are driving in a 55 mile per hour (mph) zone. Now, that is the speed limit, or, in other words, the limitation of traffic/vehicle speed. Now, if you are going 55 mph, then you are going 100% of the allocated speed. That is, you are going 55 in a 55 zone.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you are going 50 mph, in that same 55 mph zone, then you are going 90.90% of the allocated speed (50 / 55). So, you are going ~ 9.1% under the speed limit (5 / 55). Now, if you are going 5 mph over the speed limit, or 60 mph, then you are going ~ 9.1% over the speed limit, or, 109% of the allocated speed limit (60 / 55). Now, 109% over the posted speed limit is not that bad.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us assume that you are going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. 65 / 55 is equal to 1.18, so, you are going 118% over the speed limit. Now, what about 7 mph over the speed limit (in a 55 mph zone)? Well, 62 mph translates to ~ 113% of the speed limit, or 13% over the speed limit.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us take that 7 mph and translate it to a few different speeds, which tend to be common road speeds (at least in Wisconsin), as well as what 5 mph over the speed limit would be, as well as 10 mph over. All percentages are rounded to the nearest percent (1%) in this and in later tables.

I do not think, however, that you clearly understood my main points about the goals, or end, of life. Please find here my thoughts regarding this. I look forward to your comments regarding this. As I said before, everything leads towards one goal, which &#39;results&#39; in the end of history. After all, the telos is final, and therefore leaves room for no other causes.

See the complete script for Waking Life. There is more to this then the discussion about God. This is packed full with a lot of various things, all of which deserve some time. I&#39;ll start with this passage first. However, before I do that, I should point out that I&#39;m not sure whether or not these two are both film directors.

As with the 19th century figure Kierkegaard, one could quite easily ask whether the 19th century writer Nietzsche is a philosopher. After all, if we compare their writings to the writings of such 19th century philosophers as Hegel and Schopenhauer, we are confronted with quite a difference. Yet, basing our decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the format of their writings is, I believe, flawed. Rather, one should base their decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the <em>content</em> of the writings. For this paper, I will be doing exactly this: I will be looking at the content of Nietzsche&#39;s writings in order to show that he is doing philosophy, and is therefore a philosopher.

                                It&#39;s said that &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned,&quot; but is that really true? How can it be that by saving something you earn it? Doesn&#39;t the fact that you already have, in this case, a penny prohibit you from earning it, since we usually give something to someone and say they earned it...? After some thought regarding this topic I have come to find a possible answer to the question of what this saying means.

While the exact date of the foundation of Thebes, located 30 miles northwest of Athens in eastern Boeotia, has not been clearly established, ruins have been found dating back to 1300 B.C. (Wiseman, p.624). One of the reasons that so little is known about Thebes is that it doesn&#39;t play any major roles in history until the sixth century B.C. However, one myth concerning Thebes&#39; origin does exist that is important to mention due to its inclusion of known figures of Greek tragedy.

                                Michael Dawson, in his book Understanding Cognitive Science attempts to provide a basic understanding of cognitive science, specifically by dealing with and using the &quot;tri-level&quot; hypothesis. For this paper, I will be discussing the tri-level hypothesis and what it tells us about cognitive science. One of the major problems in any science is the problem of discussing the findings within a set field with people outside of the field. Because of this problem, time is instead spent on some lesser subjects, such as sports and the weather.

                                I recently, while daydreaming yet again in a class, happened upon the phrase residing on the side of a McDonald&#39;s cup stating that &quot;Change is Good&quot;. I, of course, am quite familiar with this saying, however, I was a tad confused. Because of this confusion, I decided that it would be best for me to go ahead and examine the saying &quot;Change is Good&quot; in order to see just what was meant by this saying.

Might as well type them up and trash the paper &hellip; &#39;U.S.&#39; versus &#39;Them&#39; While most people believe that the popular saying &quot;us versus them&quot; means, or says, that it&#39;s you with anyone else versus those contrary to you in some regard - the &#39;thems.&#39; However, it is not so much that is you and your group versus &#39;them&#39; as it is the United States versus &#39;them&#39; - namely those that are not the allies of the United States, but sometimes even the allies of the United States.

Quite a few years ago I took a lower level Introduction to Biology course in college. While I did pretty bad in the course, I did learn quite a few things. One of the things that I learned was about the &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;. The &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;, as I now understand it - whether or not it was taught like this - is that all biological beings are born/created (not in the &#39;Creation&#39; sense, but rather as a way to express plants, which are not born, per se, and some animals, which are hatched, and are not, per se, born) with certain desires/strivings. These strivings are applicable to any, and all, biological entities. For this article, I&#39;d like to discuss the Biological Imperative in various ways. First, I&#39;d like to describe what I believe the Biological Imperative is, at it&#39;s fundamental root - at a level basic, and truly applicable, to any and all biological entities. Then, I&#39;d like to mention how culture appears to fit into all of this, bringing in Philosophy when possible and applicable.

Starting from the truth that &quot;the world is my representation&quot; [3], Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <em>The World as Will and Representation</em> lays down what Schopenhauer believes the world is. After determining that the world is not only representation, but also will, he goes on to discuss how this all works together, and how other philosophers work into this system. For this paper, I will be focusing on the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism within this work.

There&#39;s a lot going on with this, Arnold becoming the next Governor, and I&#39;ve put off writing this page for that reason, as well as for a few other reasons... Anyways, even though I live in Wisconsin, I figured I&#39;d tackle a few of the things that I&#39;ve thought whilst paying attention to this. Here goes :)

I urge you to follow along, with my example, on your own computer.

                                According to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the dialectic &quot;is in general the principle of all motion, of all life, and of all activation in the actual world&quot;, as well as &quot;the soul of all genuinely scientific cognition.&quot; [1: 171] In other words, Hegel believes that the dialectic is the soul - the spirit one may say - of scientific cognition, or thought, as per the second quote. Because of this, if one wants to perform science, if one wants to study, and understand, the world around oneself, the dialectic must be used, and understood.

No statements of, &quot;You just have to believe.&quot; Well, here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons which suggest that God exists.&quot; [1] Sounds like an interesting, and bold, statement. After all, people have been attempting to prove God&#39;s existence by use of reason almost as long, and as much, as they have been using force to.

I brought you the timeline for Pulp Fiction (see my paper titled Pulp Fiction: A Timeline of the Events of the Movie), now I bring you the timeline for the movie 12 Monkeys, another interesting, and time-wise &#39;weird&#39;, movie. As I see it, it&#39;s something like this. Well, first, note that this is the timeline in terms of real time, not in terms of movie time.

It is said that &quot;Idle Hands Are The Devil&#39;s Tools&quot;, meaning that when one is bored, one tends to get into trouble. I have a problem, or concern, with this statement however. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m bored and I end up setting fire to a kerosene soaked blanket which ends up leading to my home becoming engulfed in flames. Now, if we want to get technical, which is exactly what I want to do, then as soon as my hands are no longer idle - as soon as I begin to do something with my hands - they are not the devil&#39;s tools, right?

So, you&#39;re chewing on something, who knows exactly what (well, you know what - use your imagination) when you come to the realization that there is a hair in your mouth. You may not have any idea where it came from, whether it is a hair off of the top of your head, that fell onto your food, or what, but you know that it&#39;s in your mouth now. It&#39;s a fairly long hair, an inch and a half to two inches long probably. Anyways, one way or another, the hair is now in your mouth. Yet, for some reason, you decide not to take it out of your mouth. Instead, you decide that you don&#39;t really want to put your fingers in your mouth, for whatever reason. So, you munch on your food and end up swallowing your food. Yet, for some reason, the hair gets stuck in your throat. You attempt to clear your throat - once, twice - yet&nbsp;... nothing really happens, other then the hairs focus in your mind. That is, you realize, more and more, that the hair does not seem to be moveable. You clear your throat again and feel a pain, like getting a paper cut. Know what that feels like, when you finally realize that you have a paper cut? It&#39;s&nbsp;... well, let&#39;s imagine what that feels like now&nbsp;...

                                One of the most heard sayings in the customer service business is &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. The common meaning of this statement is that no matter what the customer says, they are to be treated as though they are correct. Let us take an example. Customer orders a burger with no ketchup and with no cheese. They ask for it to be this way. Then, after getting their burger, they come up to the counter and say that they didn&#39;t get the cheese on the burger, even though they asked for it.

                                Another version of this, slightly updated it seems, is also available, titled Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Summa Theologica and the Question of the Will. Whenever I think about Medieval Philosophy, from this point on after taking this class, I will also think about religion. When I think about religion I think about God and free will. So, since I need to have a topic for this final analysis, I decided that I should probably take one of these topics, and find some writer who would be the best to analysis in this area.

                                This semester, we looked at Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, Tim Crane&rsquo;s Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, and The Cambridge Companion to Husserl. Through these writings we have learned more about the Theory of Intentionality, from two different perspectives, the Analytic Philosophy tradition &ndash; as shown by Corrado and Crane &ndash; and the Phenomenological tradition &ndash; as showcased by Husserl, or, more perhaps more appropriately, the individuals writing on Husserl.

Algazali, in The Incoherence of the Philosophers, argues that &ldquo;what is customarily believed to be cause and what is believed to be an effect is not necessary, according to our opinion; but each of the two [namely, cause and effect] is independent of the other.&rdquo; [1: 283] In other words, while philosophers believe that there exists such a law that if x occurs then y occurs &ndash; that there is a system of cause and effect &ndash; Algazali believes that there is no relationship between cause and effect.

                                Francis Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis was the first chosen source to read for this Age of Reason class. Bacon&#39;s work best fits as a beginning reading for various reasons, one of which is the applicability of the book as showcasing the major ideas of the Age of Reason at the beginning of their formation, in many cases. For this paper, I will begin by examining Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis, in a specific area, and then pursuing that area&#39;s progress, or reiteration, in some of the other readings from this age.

                                In this paper, I will be trying to discuss Edmund Husserl&rsquo;s theory of impossible objects and meanings in the Logical Investigations.&nbsp; His theories of experience, knowledge, truth, and fact, will also be discussed in an attempt to determine their relation to these impossible things.&nbsp; By looking at the Logical Investigations Investigation by Investigation, I hope to see where he speaks of his ideas of experience, knowledge, truth and fact.&nbsp; After looking at these ideas, I should be able to end by speaking of impossible things.

The importance of one person when there are x people: x people % that one person equals (1/x)*100 1 100 2 50 3 33.3 4 25 5 20 6 16.6 7 14.285714 8 12.5 9 11.1 10 10 11 9.09 12 8.3 13 7.692307 14 7.142857 15 6.6 16 6.25 17 5.8823529411764705 18 5.5 19 5.263157894736842105 20 5 21 4.761904 22 4.54 23 4.347826086956521739130 24 4.16 25 4 26 3.846153 27 3.703 28 3.571428 29 3.4482758620689655172413793103 30 3.3 31 3.225806451612903 32 3.125 33 3.03 34 2.9411764705882352 35 2.857142 With these 35 results, we see that the importance of one, in percent, decreases fairly quickly, and then slowly goes lower.

                                Often times we will hear one say to another that they do not believe in God. They will then say, as a way to prove to the other that they are right, that God does not exist, that if God exists then God would have the power to strike him down, as he is a non-believer. Of course, this cannot happen for various reasons, which I will attempt to discuss below.

                                In Tim Crane&rsquo;s book, Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, we are given a contemporary look at the Analytic Tradition, and their use of the ideas of Intentionality to come to the truth about perception and thought.&nbsp; Crane attempts to explain to the reader how perception and thought are related, as well as the role of intentionality in relation to perception and thought. For the most part, when we speak of the terms &lsquo;perception&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought&rsquo; we can rely almost solely upon a particular individual.&nbsp; For example, imagine that we have one individual, whom we will call Gavin, looking at some object, which, for simplicity, we will say is a particular can of Dr Pepper sitting in front of him.

                                1. According to Augustine, God is not responsible for the existence of evil. What is his argument? Present the argument in detail. In On Free Will, Augustine speaks of man&rsquo;s freedom to will, or make decisions, for himself. He also speaks of evil, and how a man can do evil, as well as where evil comes from. Now, Augustine believes that man is inclined to do Good, which is to follow God and seek out happiness, through virtuous activity, and not through the goods of this physical world.

                                The following is a paper written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. Every time I heard someone speak of scholasticism I never quite knew what they meant. Having heard of it in many classes in the philosophy of religion &lsquo;genera&rsquo;, I was convinced that it was something that refers to philosophers who dealt with the philosophy of religion, and specifically in the time period of the medieval era &ndash; especially around the years of St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine.

                                This paper was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. The material of this text analysis will be Peter Abailard and his work The Glosses of Peter Abailard on Porphyry. As Abailard tells us, &ldquo;There are then three questions, as Boethius says, secret and very useful and tried by not a few philosophers, but solved by few. The first is as follows, namely, whether genera and species subsist or are placed in the naked understandings alone, etc., as if he were to say: whether they have true being or whether they consist in opinion alone.

                                In Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, we are introduced to the analytical tradition in a way that has not been attempted since the time of this book. Instead of bundling philosophical works into an anthology Corrado attempts to explain what the fundamental characteristics are that tie these thinkers together. For this paper, I focus solely on the problems of perception and thought in the earlier analytic tradition, as Corrado discusses in this work, particularly on the first part, in which he discusses the background of the tradition &ndash; and therefore the earlier tradition.

                                The following was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. In Augustine&rsquo;s The City of God, Augustine discusses what he thinks the City of God would be like. While there is no one particular page or passage that especially stuck out for me, I&rsquo;m going focus on what Augustine says about other gods/religions and how that compares to what many people think in today&rsquo;s society. For this analysis, I would like to show some of the reasons that I think this.

Screen capture from 2002.12.08 Basically, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not as clear as one would like, I visited http://www.aol.com/ and received this message. After reading the message, I pulled up the information on my browser (Help -&gt; About Internet Explorer) and took a snapshot (using XnView). Imagine my surprise - well, not really - when I found that the browser I was using was the browser that they wanted me to use, if I wasn&#39;t going to use their browser of course...

                                For over 2500 years, philosophers have debated on such issues as rights, reality, freedom, and justice. In all of those years, one decision on what is meant by these terms has never been set in stone; a final definition - or answer - has never been reached. Therefore, when someone asks the philosopher, or even one who has merely studied philosophy, what justice is, or what any of the other terms mean exactly, there is typically not one answer that is prevalent to all.

                                Edmund Husserl, in his Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy, begins by discussing natural cognition and experience. Husserl explores experience, believing that experience is how we view the world around us. However, it is not enough to know that experience gives us insight. According to Husserl, we must, primarily, know how we are conscious of the world around us, before we can talk about the actuality of what we see.

                                The nineteenth century could be described as containing three major movements; Romanticism, Realism, and Modernism. Each movement has its own important features and major themes that have had an effect on the present day world. If I had to state one of the major themes of the entire nineteenth century, it would be the increase of the power of man and science. The beginning of the nineteenth century saw writers such as Mary Shelley, with her work Frankenstein.

                                Part I The question of what it is that makes one particular experiment ethical while another is unethical is a troublesome question. Is the ethicalness of a scientific experiment based upon whether the subject is harmed, whether the subject&#39;s rights have been in some way infringed upon, or is it based upon some other criteria? In this paper, I will take the position that it is not whether the subject was harmed, or whether their rights were infringed upon, but rather that it is ultimately power that determines the ethicalness of an experiment (position IV).

                                One of the most prevalent themes in the readings for this class has been religion, or mysticism, and its influence on and necessity for both man and society. The question that keeps arising is, however, can man and society live do without religion, or something similar? The modern man has more trust, for the most part, in science then he has in religion. However, what does this mean? First, I would like to take a look at what religion has done for man, in relation to the readings in general.

                                See also my paper tiled: Philosophy, Politics, and Law Final Regarding Justice and Various Philosophers. For my paper, I was going to attempt to answer what justice is. Obviously, Plato&#39;s Republic will be of use for this topic. Particularly his discussion with others, as well as how he thinks the state should be setup. I&#39;m not going to put any of Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince in my paper, because I wasn&#39;t too much of a fan of him, and he doesn&#39;t really go into what justice &#39;really&#39; is.

                                <p>Recently, while listening to a philosophical discussion, I came to hear that there were not two kinds of inference (deductive and inductive), as I thought before, but instead that there were three kinds; deductive, inductive, and abductive. Wanting to know more about abductive reasoning, I did a little search, finding the following information.</p>

                                In his Notes from Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky asks what it is that civilization, or society in general, gives to the individual. In essence, the question concerns where the individual resides in society; what can be learned from man&#39;s place in a society? Dostoevsky presents to the reader a conflicted, sickly individual, and explores why the individual is the way he is, as well as whether society could do anything to help him from his lowly state.

                                <p>It is important to mention what sentential logic is. While my guide has been out for almost two years now, I&rsquo;ve yet to discuss what these rules are for. Sentential logic is one logical system, by which conclusions can be reached via premises, which may or may not be true. The truth of the premises does not concern sentential logic. Rather, sentential logic will tell you what conclusions necessarily come from the premises posited.</p>

                                In this paper, I will be discussing the points that Antony Flew contributes to the debate on whether religious claims must be proven by empirical means in order to be factually meaningful. First, I will discuss Flew&rsquo;s major contribution, which is the analogy of the gardener. Second, I will discuss why this analogy helps to show that religious claims make no assertions, and are instead mere utterances. Flew begins his piece with a parable.

I can honestly admit that I haven&#39;t read over this in a very long time, but the skimming that I have done reminds me of certain things ... As time progresses I may go back and re-purpose this content. (Of particular note, also, will be at what time these were written and when I was reading certain philosophical works.) One has to question many of the things that many people take as being commonplace, or common knowledge.

                                During the period of Romanticism, art and literature was attempting to get back to, and raise interest in, the natural. With more people in cities, as well as the effects of Industrialization, many were feeling that man was moving too fast. For this paper, I am going to talk about man&#39;s quest for dominance over nature, with particular interest in Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein. Throughout history, man has been trying to become a controller of nature.

                                Descartes&rsquo; rationalist notion of necessary and contingent connections between simple natures has an important role in his Meditations. This, in turn, has an impact on other philosophers to come, in relation to the problems that the Meditations raise. This paper will first deal with simple natures, their connections, and their role in Descartes&rsquo; Meditations. After looking at Descartes, three other philosophers will be looked at to see how they deal with the ideas brought up by Descartes.

                                What is the impact that civilization and its laws have on the individual? Particularly in the case of values and morality, does civilization help define one's values, or does it subvert them, leaving behind only those values that it can use in order to survive and converting those it can not? For this paper, I would like to look at Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and show how Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents is related to this story.

                                &ldquo;Let us suppose that organ transplant procedures have been perfected; in such circumstances if two dying patients could be saved by organ transplants then, if surgeon have the requisite organs in stock and no other needy patients, but nevertheless allow their patients to die, we would be inclined to say, and be justified in saying, that the patients died because the doctors refused to save them. But if there are no spare organs in stock and none otherwise available, the doctors have no choice, they cannot save their patients and so must let them die.&rdquo; (Harris, 257) This, the start of John Harris&rsquo; article, gives a possible future situation that seems to be straightforward, in that most of us would find that the first situation would be a case of a &lsquo;wrongful&rsquo; death, and the second a case of unfortunate circumstances.

                                From the introductory material, we learn that the Great Learning &quot;gives the Confucian educational, moral, and political programs in a nutshell&quot; (1: 84). These ideas are summed up as, and consist of; manifesting the clear character of man, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good. There are also eight steps that should be followed; &quot;the investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of the will, rectification of the mind, cultivation of the personal life, regulation of the family, national order, and world peace&quot; (1: 84).

                                This semester we have looked at many different philosophers from the pre-Socratic up to Aristotle. For this paper, I will be talking about Aristotle&rsquo;s Nichomachean Ethics and my view of what Aristotle states in this work. Specifically, I will be focusing on his view of happiness and comparing it with my view on happiness. Aristotle first begins Nichomachean Ethics by giving a definition of the good. &ldquo;The good, therefore, has been well defined as that at which all things aim.&rdquo; (Baird, 364) He also states, &ldquo;In cases where the end lies beyond the action the product is naturally superior to the activity&rdquo; (Baird, 364), meaning that the product of an action is more important then the action itself.

                                So far this semester, we have looked at four different writers of the Renaissance period. Of all of them, I personally found Montaigne to be the most interesting and appealing author. For this final paper, I will be discussing Montaigne&rsquo;s use of the self and the main points of the pieces that we read, followed by what I think about Montaigne&rsquo;s writing. The first piece that we read by Montaigne was Essay 14 in Book I: &ldquo;That the taste of good and evil things depends in large part on the opinion we have of them&rdquo;.

                                For my chapter synopsis, I read Chapter XIX. Of the Dissolution of Government for John Locke. This chapter deals with dissolving the government; how governments are dissolved, and what do to when they are. He says that governments are either overturned from without, or from within. When a foreign force conquests the commonwealth, the current government can not survive. Therefore, we return to the state of nature, and are free to survive alone, or find another way to survive, with another government.

                                The following paper was written for an Ancient Philosophy course that I took in college. I have not reviewed it since. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato about Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played in not only the past, but also the influence that he has today. In this paper, I will be discussing the main reasons that Socrates had such an influence on philosophy.

                                This was the first attempt&nbsp;at The Importance of Socrates. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato on Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played not only in the past, but also the influence that he has today. From Plato, we are able to learn some of the reasons that Socrates is important. In this paper, I&rsquo;ll be discussing the main reasons that Socrates was persecuted, in the hopes that this will shed some light on why he was so important.

To sum it up very shortly, free will. Throughout the book, Erasmus is trying to show us that the Bible is filled with examples that strength the idea that an individual has free will, or the choice to do as they want, whether it be good or evil.

                                &ldquo;O my brothers, love your Country! Our country is our Home, the house that God has given us&hellip;&rdquo; (Mazzini). It&rsquo;s not hard to see why nationalism doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good idea. Nationalism is the idea that the nation that you live in is important, and that when you look at yourself, you should see your nation, and its ideals. Nationalism has been around for a very long time, probably as long as there have been nations.

                                For this paper, I went to go see The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams. This play was put on at the Weidner Center, and was the first student production that I had seen there. In fact, this was the first time that I had heard of both the story and the author. Overall, I really enjoyed The Glass Menagerie. I thought that the acting was good and I really enjoyed the story.

                                &ldquo;Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.&rdquo; (Rousseau, Chapter I). Jean-Jacques Rousseau and The Social Contract had a large impact on Western Civilization in the late 18th century. Rousseau based his ideas on some of the writings of previous philosophers, trying to form a good political theory. The Social Contract was developed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau around 1762, during the time of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. The Social Contract was based on the ideas of Baron de Montesquieu and John Locke.

I have done so and am writing this report to try to describe to you Athenian society. I have many things to tell you about; their culture and politics, the personalities of the Athenians, Athenian &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, and I want to tell you about Pericles and his &ldquo;Funeral Oration&rdquo;. Upon my arrival, one of the first things I noticed was the size of Athens.

                                In May 1998, at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, Kip Kinkel opened fire on his fellow students and his own parents. In April 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, two students opened fire on teachers and students, and then killed themselves. What caused these students to kill other students? What attracts humans to violence, and what causes some people to push aside their moral values to actually be able to commit such violent acts?

                                Objective In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel followed the pattern of inheritance in plants, hoping to understand the transmission of characteristics by heredity. A few important terms in inheritance are; Segregation: Inherited pairs of genes for traits segregate/separate into separate gametes. Phenotype: In these experiments, the observable trait of a plant. Whether it is tall or short, or green or white. Genotype: The genetic makeup of the plants. Whether it is GG, Gg, or gg, in this experiment.

                                I. Objective For my lab report, I will be discussing the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. Enzymes help a chemical reaction occur faster. The ability of an enzyme to speed up a reaction depends on the environmental conditions. My hypothesis is that if the environment is very cold the enzyme will not be able to function very well. The reason that I say this, is because at cold temperatures, reactions tend to slow down.

                                Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, is defined as having continued thoughts about performing a certain act over and over (McMahon 643). For people living with obsessive-compulsive disorder, it can be very scary to not have control over what you are thinking, and sometimes, even doing. For example, one woman would spend thirteen hours a day washing her hands and her house and if she accidentally touched something else while cleaning, it could set her off and make her spend even more time cleaning (Friedland 70).
