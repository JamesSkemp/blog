<p>
There&#39;s a handful of guides out there that list the available loot in Final Fantasy XII (for the Playstation 2).  However, none of the ones that I&#39;ve seen collect the information in a form that&#39;s both printer friendly, and in a format that makes checking things off simple.
</p>
<p>
To that effect, I&#39;ve created a five page PDF that allows you to easily check of the number of loot you&#39;ve sold, and what you&#39;ve left to find.
</p>
<p>
Corrections or omissions are greatly appreciated.
