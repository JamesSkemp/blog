<p>
The next article I&#39;ll be writing (Sunday night probably) will finally be on using those templates that I had mentioned in an earlier post, to create a basic Web site.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Obviously, if you&#39;ve been following along, you&#39;ll notice that I actually upgraded ColdFusion MX from 6.1 to 7.01 instead of writing this article.  Sorry - I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m getting more and more impressed with ColdFusion the more I use it, and the more I read about it.

<p>
ASP vs. PHP vs. CF?  ColdFusion wins, with PHP a close second (and ASP didn&#39;t even show up because it knew it was going to be pounded into the asphalt).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found a potential (free) ColdFusion host, which will allow a bit more flexibility in sharing code and it&#39;s functionality (if people don&#39;t want to install ColdFusion).
