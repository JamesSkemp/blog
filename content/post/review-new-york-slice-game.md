The following is a review of the board game New York Slice, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Delicious Fun
The idea behind [New York Slice][review] is actually pretty simple, and something you may have received a taste of as a child.

Given a full pizza, or a cake, how do you best slice it so that everyone gets a fair share? Simple: let the person that cuts it select the last piece.

New York Slice has one player lay out a full pizza and then split it, along with a special, so that there's enough for each player. Players either keep the slices they receive, or if there's pepperoni on the slice, can eat those slices for points.

The game plays 2 to 6 players, but I'd recommend 4 or so for the best games. There is also a two-player variant where the pizza is sliced into four pieces, and players end up taking two turns.

The actual game pieces are a sturdy cardboard, with very nice artwork/photography. Combined with a rulebook that looks like a menu, and a box that looks like a pizza box, with scorecards that look like guest checks, this game is strong with the theme.

Games that I played went over well, with no clear winner until the end. The only issue I've run into is boxing the game back up. While the pizza box is great, expect to keep it flat, unless you want all of the pieces sliding to the side. Since I tend to use a grocery-shaped bag when bringing my games to game lunch or to other places, I'm starting to get a little afraid that the box might start failing where it folds.

Overall, I have to grant [New York Slice][review] a full five of five stars. This game goes over well based upon how it looks (much like [Sushi Go][sushi]), how simple the general idea is, and how easy it plays. And given the price of admission, this is a no-brainer.

Highly recommended.
