<p>Got a notice of <a href="http://littlebigplanet.us.playstation.com/">http://littlebigplanet.us.playstation.com/</a>&nbsp;in my Gmail account a few moments ago.</p>
<p>I was unaware that LittleBigPlanet was already available for pre-order. I looked at Amazon, but, quite frankly, I want it rather quickly.</p>
<p>BestBuy.com doesn't have it listed, but Gamestop.com does, so ... my first online purchase through that site. Store pick-up selected, of course.</p>
<p>What I don't care for is that there will supposedly be different items available for pre-ordering, depending upon where you do so. For instance, a sticker book? Really?</p>
<p>Anywho,&nbsp;we'll see what happens. If anything, I suppose I can just cancel the pre-order, but I'm guessing Game Stop will get either the Brady guide, or one of the figures. Brady guide also makes sense&nbsp;for Amazon.</p>
<p>Sticker book? That must be some sticker book ...</p>
