<p>
Firefox 1.5.0.7 was released today.&nbsp; Once again, I found out about this by seeing a site mention it, instead of my browser notifying me ...
</p>
<p>
Ah well.&nbsp; It&#39;s recommended that you download, so go do it!&nbsp; Note that the partial download failed for me.&nbsp; Firefox actually had to download a 6.1 MB file to update Firefox, instead of the under 600 KB file it initially downloaded.&nbsp; While I was at it, I checked my Extensions for updates, which I also recommend you do as well.

And for those people still using Firefox 1.0.x - why?
