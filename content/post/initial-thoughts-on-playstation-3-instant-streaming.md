<p>Today I received my instant streaming disc for the Playstation 3 from Netflix.</p>
<p>Having now moved around and watched a video, here are my thoughts.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Note that I've watched Netflix streaming videos on my PC as well as on my Xbox 360.</p>
</div>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>As noted, currently the streaming capabilities require a <strong>disc</strong>. While this could perhaps be a download (and will be in the future), I don't believe it's too terrible that it requires a disc.</p>
<p>The <strong>disc</strong> itself isn't too shabby. The sleeve is the standard Netflix sleeve, although it seems a little stronger, and in red.</p>

<p>After a few moments the software was loaded and I was prompted to enter an <strong>activation code</strong> online. At only six characters, it was pretty simple. While they say it'll take up to 3 minutes, it took around 30 seconds. There was a similar activation for the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>You're first presented with your instant queue, and can move around by pressing a <strong>direction</strong>. Up will move you to the tabs where you can move between your instant queue, recently watched, and various categories. Unfortunately you can't hold down in a direction to move quickly through the queue, but instead must press the direction you want to move each time. However, I am able to move from the last movie to the first, which can't be done on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>However, after I had watched my first movie I started playing around; <strong>L2 and R2</strong> will move you 7 movies in whatever direction.</p>
<p>I wrote that this seems to benefit from the <strong>Playstation 3 remote</strong>, but I don't recall why.</p>
<p>I <strong>added a new movie</strong> to my instant queue&nbsp;on my PC&nbsp;and while it did not immediately show up (we're talking in seconds), by moving to a different tab and back the new movie appeared. Id est, it seems the times it goes out and grabs the listing is much more transparent.</p>
<p>The movie watching experience itself was okay. While Select on the remote displays the <strong>current/total times</strong> for standard movies, you actually had to pause the movie to see it here. There is a way to have it appear on the Xbox 360, without pausing, but I don't recall the button.</p>
<p>One thing I don't have to do on my Xbox 360 is switch my <strong>TV mode</strong> to Full screen. I believe this is a configuration issue on my end. Everything but regular DVDs and watching instant streaming videos (the interface is fine) requires that I change my TV mode so that the movie takes up all the space. Otherwise it believes my&nbsp;TV is square. Again, I believe it to a TV setting on my Sony Bravia.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong> the movie is <em>significantly</em> easier on the Playstation 3. While the Xbox 360 requires you to cycle from 3 stars to 5 to 1 to 3 again, you are able to move the 'cursor' on the Playstation 3 and 'lock in' your rating.</p>
<p>I <strong>removed the movie</strong> from my queue on my PC and unlike on the Xbox 360, it&nbsp;was not immediately removed from my queue on my Playstation 3. Switching to another tab&nbsp;and back (letting the other tab load first) worked again.</p>
<p><strong>Reordering&nbsp;items</strong> on my PC also didn't immediately take effect, without switching to another tab. Not a big deal.</p>
<p>Two tabs I currently have are <strong>"Like: ___"</strong> which are the two movies I currently have in my recently watched listing. Haven't seen this on the Xbox 360 interface.</p>
<h3>Current feelings</h3>
<p>I like it. Yes, it's an extra disc to keep about, but that's a big deal. Yes, there's the issue with moving through the queue (not so bad after I found the L2/R2 trick). But that's about it.</p>
<p>I'll update with additional thoughts, as&nbsp;I continue to watch more movies.</p>
