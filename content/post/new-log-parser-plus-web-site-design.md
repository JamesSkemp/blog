<p><a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/">My Web site on Microsoft Log Parser</a> gets a fair amount of monthly traffic, but I've never really been happy with the design, which has been in place since I created the site back in September of 2008.</p>
<p>While I was fully intending on updating the site last week (as well as doing a slew of other productive things), I <em>finally</em> did so this morning.</p>
<h3>Design 1</h3>

<h3>Design 2</h3>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://logparserplus.com/Content/Design-Version-2.png"><img style="width: 480px;" src="http://logparserplus.com/Content/Design-Version-2.small.png" alt="LogParserPlus.com second (current) design" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I'd say that's a positive change, for a non-designer such as myself. It's also the first of at least eight changes I'll be making to the site, in an attempt to increase traffic.</p>
<p>In addition to the new design I upgraded to jQuery 1.6.1, from jQuery 1.5.2, and am now using NuGet to manage that, and also put in place the async Google Analytics code, amongst other, behind-the-scenes, changes.</p>
<p>Now I just have to redesign my professional site, although realistically I'll probably add the new functionality I've been wanting to add first ...</p>
