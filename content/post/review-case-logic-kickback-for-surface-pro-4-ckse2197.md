The following is a review of the Case Logic Kickback for Surface Pro 4 (CKSE2197), provided to me as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## I'm pleasantly surprised

I've had my [Surface Pro 4][surface pro 4] since November 2015, and have been pretty good about keeping it relatively safe. However, the backing was starting to show a little wear the last few months, so when I had the opportunity to try out [Case Logic's Kickback (CKSE2197)][product], I decided to do so.

When I received the Case Logic Kickback I admittedly had a bit of a difficult time actually getting it onto the back of my Surface. For whatever reason it took me longer than it should have to determine how to slide the backing onto the Surface's stand. However, once that was done I've kept it on my device for the last 4 weeks.

The Kickback does a fairly good job of hugging the back of the Surface Pro, without causing too much of a disturbance. It does force the Surface Pen to the top of the device, in a clip, and also requires that you plug in the power cable a particular way (make note of that beforehand so that you don't end up heading to a meeting with almost no charge since you thought your Surface was plugged in, but was actually every so slightly not). It works fine with the Microsoft keyboard, and keeps the other ports open.

I've had a couple instances of the Kickback sliding above the top of the Surface, which tends to happen when the the device is pushed back a significant amount. Otherwise it stays on without issue.

I've yet to try dropping my device, but the thickness and material the Case Logic Kickback is made of does feel like it would provide a nice amount of protection from lesser drops and bumps.

Talking with a co-worker, the only thing that the device is missing is a small cut-out for the Microsoft logo on the back of the Surface, as most Apple device protectors have. ;)

Especially given the price, I'd definitely recommend [Case Logic's Kickback (CKSE2197)][product] if you have a Surface Pro 4 and are looking for some protection on the back of the device. 5 of 5 stars.
