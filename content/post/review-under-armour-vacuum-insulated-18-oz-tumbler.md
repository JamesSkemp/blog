The following is a review of the [Under Armour Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel 18 Ounce Tumbler][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## I've Spilt Almost as Much Water as I've Drank
So that headline is a bit of an exaggeration, but using this I have spilt water:

- During two standing meetings.
- All over my significant other.
- Onto/into my bag. At least twice.
- All over the front of my shirt, more times than I cared to count.

My SO also tried to drink from this and spilt water all over her face.

I may perhaps be too used to having to push a button in order to get water, as my main water storage has been Contigo for quite some time. However, at a glance you're unable to easily determine if the top of the [Under Armour Tumbler][review] is open or closed. Even drinking from it is a little inconsistent, as despite what it promises, really only two of the sides seem to give consistent liquid flow.

The tumbler itself does keep things quite cold, with at least some ice from a completely filled tumbler still lasting 24 hours later. It is wider and a little shorter than most tumblers, but it worked fine in my VW Rabbit.

The top does disassemble into two pieces, which makes cleaning of both it and the main tumbler quite easy.

There does appear to be a fill line on the inside of the container, but if you fill it to this spot, you will end up with liquid on the floor (and potentially your shoes) like I did when I first made that mistake. (Note, this spill is not counted in the list above.)

I can't recommend the [Under Armour Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel 18 Ounce Tumbler][review]. Go get a Contigo one instead. Or for the price, get two. Two of five stars since it does keep things cold.
