<p>I've picked up copies of Beginning ASP.NET 2.0; Build Your Own ASP.NET 2.0 Web Site Using C# &amp; VB; Beginning ASP.NET 2.0 E-Commerce in C# 2005 From Novice to Professional; and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735624267?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5 Step by Step</a> (the only one I can recommend). With all of these, I struggled to read them and didn't feel as though I learned much, or in the case of the last, failed to get much more than an overview of ASP.NET (albeit a good one).</p>
<p>However, with Imar Spaanjaars' book, I finally feel comfortable with ASP.NET 3.5.</p>
<p>In this book Imar works through the steps of creating of an actual, fully-functional, ASP.NET 3.5 Web site, that's actually not that bad (ignoring some questionable design).</p>
<p>Unlike other books, Imar covers both the Express and commercial versions of Visual Studio, in a very unobtrusive way. In addition, Imar doesn't rely solely on the ASP.NET components, but gives&nbsp;a good deal of actual programming, in both C# and VB (in a very clean, comfortable, way).</p>
<p>While it's true that he references a number of other Wrox books, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470187573?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Professional ASP.NET 3.5</a>,&nbsp;there is very little that needs to be examined to get a site up and running, that would suit the majority of business needs.</p>
<p>Overall, my faith in the ability of Web developers to write good books has been restored by this tome (and at over 700 pages, tome it is). A Web developer Imar is, and to us, as equals, is to whom he speaks. This is clearly seen in his summaries and tips, at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p>I give this book 5 stars of 5. If you've read the other books and been left sad, confused, and/or angry, this is the volume to pick up.</p>
<p>Note: I <em>will</em> be reading this book twice, once I've finished with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470187573?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Professional ASP.NET 3.5</a>. There is so much in this book that bears repeating, and many things that I'm sure I missed in my first read, since it's so full of (valuable) information.</p>
