<p>Resonance of Fate, available for the <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BRYHY0?tag=strivinglifen-20">Playstation 3</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BRWUA8?tag=strivinglifen-20">Xbox 360</a> (I purchased for the former), has a vast amount of data associated with it, as RPGs usually do.</p>
<p>Because I usually do, I started keeping track of levels and etcetera for the game, which is available as an XML data file.</p>
<p>The data is currently raw (and as of this post need to finish adding data that I've got on paper and on another computer), without styling, but I've been sitting on the information for far too long.</p>
