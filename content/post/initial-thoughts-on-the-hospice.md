<p>
I had occasion today to read <em>The Hospice</em>, by Robert Aickman (1914-1980). This story was in the collection <em>Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural</em> (selected by Marvin Kaye).
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I had to go to Google to try to make sense of the story, since Kaye himself suggests that the meaning is rather obscure.
</p>
<p>
A simple G search turned up a result at <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/~almahu/hospice.htm" target="_blank">some site</a>, which itself is rather odd ... in a mysterious way.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I&#39;m going to put three dots next to the title in the table of contents (that&#39;s &#39;...&#39;) so that, once I come back to this book, I&#39;ll make special note of this story.
