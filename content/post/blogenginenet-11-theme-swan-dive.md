<div class="note">
<p>Updated for BlogEngine.NET 1.3!</p>
<p>Update 8/16/2008: This theme should work fine on BlogEngine.NET 1.4.5 or lower, using the 1.3 link.</p>
</div>
<p>I'm proud to present a theme for BlogEngine.NET (tested with 1.1) called Swan Dive.</p>
<p>This theme is based upon the template of the same name by <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3161" target="_blank">Homefront Studios</a>, and made available on Open Source Web Design.</p>
<p>While this is technically my third theme for BlogEngine.NET, it's the first for public consumption.</p>
<p>A zip of the theme can be downloaded from my testing site at JamesRSkemp.net, as well as a preview of the theme, in PNG format. Both are approximately 200 KB in size.</p>
