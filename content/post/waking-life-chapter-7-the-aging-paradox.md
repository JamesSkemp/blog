Description: Script of the movie <em>Waking Life</em>, based on Tara Carreon&#39;s transcription, but with revisions based upon a viewing of the DVD version of the movie, which was watched with subtitles. 
</p>
<p>
Notes: Special thanks to Andrew, Larry Redden, and Ed Sandberg for pointing out errors in Tara&#39;s transcription (numerous errors were fixed here, along with some scene information clarifications). Absolutely let me know if anything slipped by my look-over, especially in the quicker and the &#39;like, like, you know,&#39; sections ;)

Time just dissolves into quick-moving particles that are swirling away. Either I&#39;m moving fast or time is. Never both simultaneously. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s such a strange paradox. I mean, while, technically, I&#39;m closer to the end of my life than I&#39;ve ever been, I actually feel more than ever that I have all the time in the world. When I was younger, there was a desperation, a desire for certainty, like there was an end to the path, and I had to get there. 
</p>
<p>
I know what you mean, because I can remember thinking, &quot;Oh, someday, like in my mid-thirties maybe, everything&#39;s going to just somehow gel and settle, just end.&quot; It was like there was this plateau, and it was waiting for me, and I was climbing up it, and when I got to the top, all growth and change would stop. Even exhilaration. But that hasn&#39;t happened like that, thank goodness. I think that what we don&#39;t take into account when we&#39;re young is our endless curiosity. That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about being human. 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah. Well do you know that thing Benedict Anderson says about identity? 
</p>
<!--adsense-->
<p>
No. 
</p>
<p>
Well, he&#39;s talking about like, say, a baby picture. So you pick up this picture, this two-dimensional image, and you say, &quot;That&#39;s me.&quot; Well, to connect this baby in this weird little image with yourself living and breathing in the present, you have to make up a story like, &quot;This was me when I was a year old, and then later I had long hair, and then we moved to Riverdale, and now here I am.&quot; So it takes a story that&#39;s actually a fiction to make you and the baby in the picture identical to create your identity. 
</p>
<p>
And the funny thing is, our cells are completely regenerating every seven years. We&#39;ve already become completely different people several times over, and yet we always remain quintessentially ourselves. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm.
