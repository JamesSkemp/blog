<p>
Mr. Bruce Springsteen,
</p>
<p>
While I can&#39;t remember the exact date, or even the year, it was shortly after my parents had divorced, and my father moved out into the country, that I first listened to <u>Born in the U.S.A.</u>; it was one of my father&#39;s old tapes. Now, I really wonder that I didn&#39;t wear that old tape out.
</p>
<p>
I was pre-teen, and living in northern Wisconsin, and raised Catholic,&nbsp;so not all of the lyrics made sense (not that I really thought about them all that much outside of remembering the exact order, so I could sing the songs by heart), so in that sense, I certainly was lacking an understanding of what they really meant.
</p>
<p>
But, they sounded really great, and I was old and smart enough to realize the few that were applicable at the time, being in &#39;love,&#39; and, for the first time in that state, also having the one I really liked (for that&#39;s what it was), like me as well. They were all great songs, but some really stuck with me; &quot;I&#39;m On Fire,&quot; &quot;Downbound Train,&quot; &quot;Cover Me,&quot; &quot;Glory Days,&quot; &quot;Dancing In The Dark,&quot; and &quot;My Hometown&quot; (which I would think of many times in my near future).
</p>
<p>
Later, I would ask for, and receive, one of my first CDs, getting not <u>Born in the U.S.A.</u> as I asked for, but instead <u>Greatest Hits</u>. While it had many of the songs I had enjoyed previously, it wasn&#39;t <u>Born in the U.S.A.</u>.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t recall if &quot;The River&quot; struck me the first time that I heard it, but it would become, and continues to be, one of my favorite songs; period. Too I was introduced to your harder side via &quot;Murder Incorporated,&quot; and your political side (still being in the dark about &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;&#39;s meaning) via &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia.&quot;
</p>
<p>
As time progressed, I continued to pick up more and more of your music, as I found it. During that time, it was <u>Live 1975-1985</u> that absolutely made &quot;The River&quot; the song that it is to me today, and perhaps also when I began to <em>understand</em> your music (although perhaps I could argue against that, based on the above listing of songs from <u>Born in the U.S.A.</u>).
</p>
<p>
As of today, I can look at the listing of albums on your official site and, with the exception of the DVDs, of which I have only one (not listed; your music videos), I can honestly say I have every one. Of all the other artists I enjoy, I can say that of none other.
</p>
<p>
As I purchase your new music, I realize that while&nbsp;I may not like all of it, that comes more from a lack of understanding, or experience, of what you sing about. While there are some songs that I believe instantly impart their meaning (most of those listed above, &quot;The Fever,&quot; etcetera), there are others that require more thought and experience (&quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; etcetera). And through the years, I&#39;ve found that little extra work to be well worth it.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;m young enough to have not lived through the beginning of music&#39;s greatest periods of change, I&#39;m grateful I was at least able to live during the times of one of the greatest legends of music.
</p>
<p>
Very sincerely,
</p>
<p>
James Skemp
