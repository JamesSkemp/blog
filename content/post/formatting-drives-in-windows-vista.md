<p>
So Disk Management can&#39;t be found using the Vista Start Search.

However, you can&nbsp;type in&nbsp;Computer Management, and get to Disk Management from there.

From what I was reading online, as long as the BIOS sees the drive, Windows should have popped up a message asking about formatting it. Too bad you have to go through this extra step - it would have been nice to have at least seen a small pop-up regarding this.
