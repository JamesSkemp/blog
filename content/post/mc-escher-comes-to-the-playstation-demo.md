<p>
After all the hype, I finally had the chance to actually play a demo of echochrome, the <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/" target="_blank">M.C. Escher</a>-ish game that&#39;s coming out for the Playstation 3 and PSP. 
</p>
<p>
The first Google result, for a YouTube video, gives&nbsp;an excellent presentation of what the game is like. 
</p>
<p>
However, at least in the demo, the camera controls seem sluggish. Perhaps the Sixaxis motion control would make this easier - I haven&#39;t tried it yet. 
</p>
<p>
Either way, I&#39;m especially looking forward to this (even more than flower), even more so since you can supposedly make your own levels. 
</p>
<p>
Very cool.
