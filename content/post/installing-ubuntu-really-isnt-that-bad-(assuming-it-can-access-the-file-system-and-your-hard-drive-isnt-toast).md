<p>
After attempting at least twice before to install Ubuntu onto a computer, I&#39;ve finally done so this evening.  As Gavin would say, &quot;Woot!&quot;<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
The first time I attempted an install, it turns out the hard drive is probably toast (not because of Ubuntu).
</p>
<p>
The second time, I tried on a computer that already had a partial (?) Debian install - Ubuntu couldn&#39;t access the file system, for whatever reason.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
The third time I just installed the server version.  It worked, but no GUI meant no easy network setup.  I&#39;m a techie, but it takes a whole other kind of person to get Linux that hard-core.
</p>
<p>
The fourth, and final time, I setup Ubuntu 6.06.1, with no problems (although install was very slow).  The one thing I regret is not having a faster computer to do the install on.  The machine I&#39;m using is an old HP Pavilion XE734 with perhaps a slight RAM upgrade.  It&#39;s not that bad, it&#39;s just not as fast as I&#39;d like.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got a faster computer with more RAM sitting around, but I really don&#39;t want to use it, since it does have XP SP2 ...  If push comes to shove, however, that&#39;s probably what I&#39;ll end up using.
</p>
<p>
I was hoping to use my sister&#39;s machine, which appeared to have Windows-related issues, but unfortunately it looks like it was really the hard drive.  Transplanting it into another system resulted in the same problem - the inability to boot.  I&#39;ll have to try yet a different hard drive in her box to verify that it&#39;s not the graphics card (as I originally thought), and then we can go in the direction of picking up a hard drive for her, or giving her one of my own.
</p>
<p>
Either way, I think Ubuntu will be a good choice for her.  It may not give her all that she&#39;d like, as far as programs, but it&#39;ll be secure and allow her to email and etcetera.
</p>
