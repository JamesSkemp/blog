<p>
She was one cool cat, as they used to say...
</p>
<p>
I was in love with her, but couldn&#39;t tell her, couldn&#39;t put my heart out on the table...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d done it before. I&#39;d tell someone, and I&#39;d only end up with pain, a blistering pain. I have chunks missing, each time, I have less on the scale. I try my best, I know that I do, but it&#39;s hard, you know?
</p>
<p>
Crushes, loves, they are all the same. Each time one fails, another brick in the wall...
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to believe, that you can find a love, when everything seems to imply the opposite. How do you know, when it all comes down to it?
</p>
<p>
How do you know that the one you love loves you back?
</p>
<p>
Maybe you can&#39;t, after all, that&#39;s what the songs say. But, nonetheless, you want to believe, you want to know that there is someone...
</p>
<p>
She was the one, or so I thought. Could I ask her? No. Too many cuts, too much pain. I kept my feelings inside, buried deep inside. I&#39;m not one to tell people about these feelings that I keep locked inside. How do I know that they too do not wish to bring me pain, sadness, tears?
</p>
<p>
One says love is good, one says love is bad... who in hell do you trust? Can&#39;t trust my mom, can&#39;t trust my sis... Friends? Them I don&#39;t have...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It was something about her - but weren&#39;t they all like that in some ways? Of course they were. Maybe it would be better to be her friend, forget anything serious. You&#39;re bound to be hurt if you try...
</p>
<p>

<p>
How can you ask someone, someone so perfect in your eyes, if they&#39;ll join you for dinner? I&#39;m no mind reader, I can&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in that head of hers... I know people with pain - but what&#39;s worse; trying and failing, or not trying at all? If you try you have a chance at least. Everyone has to try, but what about the relationship you already have with them? Friends or lovers, one or the other... or so they say...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Oh, how I wish to hold her in my arms, to let myself become one with another person, but how I avoid it... Potential pain - what is it worth?
</p>
