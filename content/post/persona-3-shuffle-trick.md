<p>
I&#39;ve spent a couple of hours, the last couple of days, playing Persona 3 (Playstation 2). After winning certain battles, you can get a &#39;shuffle&#39; mode of two or three cards (at least, as far as I&#39;ve gotten). 
</p>
<p>
So, you see what the cards are, they turn over, and then they&#39;re shuffled. They are all usually good, but just to different degrees; for example, you might already have what one of the card would give, and you&#39;ve been getting real crap for what another card would give, ... and there&#39;s also the odd card, every once in a while, that actually is fairly bad. 
</p>
<p>
Anywho, I&#39;ve determined that there is a system to it. 
</p>
<p>
For two cards, if they shuffle slowly, the cards will just be switched around; the first card will now be the second, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
For two cards, if they shuffle fast, the cards will be in the same spots as when they started. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only near the end of May, and have just started into block 2, but it seems to be working thus far. 
</p>
<p>
There seems to be a similar system for three cards as well - they move one to the right for some shuffle, I think ... 
</p>
<p>
So, I obviously need to figure that out as well, but ... it&#39;s a start.&nbsp;
