<p>
I&#39;ve almost completed converting the WordPress theme to a BlogEngine.NET theme.
</p>
<p>
The only hard part is when BlogEngine.NET (or ASP.NET) restricts write access to the CSS file. In these cases I have to tweak the CSS file using Firebug. It&#39;s a bit of a chore, since BlogEngine.NET compresses the CSS file so much (which is a good thing, in the long term), but since I&#39;m also changing the file locally in Dreamweaver, it&#39;s just a matter of copying and pasting (over the Firebug CSS content).
