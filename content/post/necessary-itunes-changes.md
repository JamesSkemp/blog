<p>
Moving from my XP to my Vista machine, for purchasing and using iTunes, it seems I&#39;ve got some changes to make.

<ol>
	<li>
	<div>
	Edit &gt; Preferences... &gt; Store &gt; Buy using a Shopping Cart
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Edit &gt; Preferences... &gt; Store &gt; Automatically check for available downloads
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
