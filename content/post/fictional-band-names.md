<p>
The following is a listing of fictional band names, which I have thought up. While I believe there was a story regarding the first two, I can&#39;t seem to find it (I&#39;m posting these on September 2, 2007, so quite some time has gone by since thinking these up) ...
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Delicious Nutritious</li>
	<li>D&eacute;j&agrave; vu Child</li>
	<li>Peace Pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>
The third seems too much like an album by Sir Paul, to be of much good these days ... The first one, having once again run across it, years later, still holds a place in my heart. If my once-dream of being in a band comes true (...) I&#39;ll have to try to make that one stick.<br />
