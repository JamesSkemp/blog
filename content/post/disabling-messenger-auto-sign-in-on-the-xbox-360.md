<p>
Shortly after logging into Xbox Live the Xbox 360 will attempt to log into Windows Messenger, by default.
</p>
<p>
While I tried to find how to disable this,&nbsp;all&nbsp;of the articles I found were irrelevant, since they were written during the &#39;blades&#39; interface.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s how I stumbled on it.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<div>
	Press the Xbox button on your controller.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Go to the Settings tab.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Select Profile.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Select Auto Sign-In.
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Select Disabled under Windows Messenger.
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
For some reason I had to do this a couple of times for it to stick.
