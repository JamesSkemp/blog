&quot;This area was once intended as the Fear East&#39;s most important information center, a Special Economic Zone in its heyday. These towers survive as a shadow of the city&#39;s former glory. Its dubious sovereignty has made it the ideal haven for multi-nationals and the criminal elements that feed off their spoils. It&#39;s a lawless zone, beyond the reach of UN or E-police.

<p>
&quot;Sorry to interrupt, but we&#39;re about to fly over Locus Solus. This pass is for you, so take a good look.
</p>
<p>
&quot;So much for the free tour. Prepare for landing.&quot;

<p>
&quot;&#39;His legions, angel forms, who lay entranced. Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks.&#39;&quot;

<p>
&quot;Now you&#39;re quoting Milton, but we are not Satan.&quot;
