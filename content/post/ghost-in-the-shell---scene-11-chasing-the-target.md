<h3>[11 Chasing the Target]</h3>
<p>
(We switch back to Kusanagi in the helicopter. We see also the preparations taking place.) 
</p>
<p>
Chief. 
</p>
<p>
Ishikawa? Well? 
</p>
<p>
I dove the MFA net and found some interesting things for you. 
</p>
<p>
Hold on, let me get a secure channel. 
</p>
<p>
Okay? First, that guy who was with Nakamura. He&#39;s an American. Dr. Willis, head of strategic research at Neutron Corp. Top man in the field of A.I. research. Anyway, he was made head of a Foreign Ministry project. And who do you think the project&#39;s main programmer was? 
</p>
<p>
Get to the point. 
</p>
<p>
Mizuho Daita. Age: 28. Remember him? He was the guy Section 6 was trying so hard to keep from defecting. The Major had to take out the diplomat who was going to take him. That programmer. 
</p>
<p>
Continue. 
</p>
<p>
What bothers me is that this project was started a year before the Puppet Master first appeared. 
</p>
<p>
A year? Wasn&#39;t the project started to catch him? 
</p>
<p>
Try this on for size. They started the project to chase the Puppet Master, but not to capture him. I think they wanted to get him back. The day before the minister&#39;s interpreter was ghost-hacked he said he wanted a good excuse to deport Maless, right? I think we may have been taken for a ride. Suppose the &quot;Puppet Master&quot; is really a program the MFA created to grease the wheels of diplomacy, so to speak. Now suppose, for some reason, they suddenly lost control of it. That would explain why they&#39;d risk assaulting Section 9 to get it back. If the Puppet Master started talking it&#39;d be an international incident. Not one you could solve by having the minister resign. 
</p>
<p>
Any details on the project? 
</p>
<p>
The protection they have only let me get the file&#39;s name. Code: 2501. 
</p>
<p>
Keep at it. And don&#39;t let them know you&#39;re in there. 
</p>
<p>
Roger. 
</p>
<p>
Project 2501 ... The Puppet Master Project... 
</p>
<p>
Target now contacting another vehicle. 
</p>
<p>
Batou! 
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s stopped at a white sedan on the side of the road. They&#39;re transferring something from the back seat. They&#39;re moving again. So&#39;s that sedan. 
</p>
<p>
A decoy? 
</p>
<p>
Or one meant to look like one. What do I do? 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll take the white sedan. 
</p>
<p>
How do you know he&#39;s in there? Another whisper from your ghost? 
</p>
<p>
Maybe. 
</p>
<p>
I knew she&#39;d say that. 
</p>

<p>
Target 02 leaving highway 25, headed for Old Town. 
</p>
<p>
Target 01 is staying on highway 25, towards the airport. Will contact roadblock in two minutes. Evacuation complete. Traffic is clear 2km behind the target. 
</p>
<p>
Anything between you and him? 
</p>
<p>
Nothing. Ready when you are. 
</p>
<p>
Do it. 
</p>
<p>
(They effectively take out the vehicle.) 
</p>
<p>
Get him? 
</p>
<p>
Nothing. 
</p>
<p>
Jesus, what a mess! Did you have to go that far? 
</p>
<p>
Take them in. And tell the chief to get the Major some backup. See you. 
</p>
<p>
Since when does that Amazon need any backup?
