<h3>An enjoyable story, with minor puzzles</h3>

<p>I find point and click adventures to be generally enjoyable, but the older I get the more interest I have in the story they tell than the puzzles.</p>

<p>So when I finally started playing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/260570/" rel="external">Gray Matter</a>, which I received for very cheap as part of a bundle, my main focus was on the story. Having now put almost 12 hours into it (having let the game run a bit, it was probably closer to 11), I have to say I ultimately enjoyed the game, and might seek out more of Jane Jensen's works (a writer on the game).</p>

<p>The game follows Sam/Samantha as she interacts with David and the other characters we meet. As she is a magician, the puzzles mostly involve her performing tricks or solving puzzles as she gets closer to her goal of becoming a master magician. However, the focus of the game is not on the tricks, but rather the story.</p>

<p>There are some interesting twists as the story progresses, and it had me shivering in a few spots. I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for an interesting story, and have at least a passing enjoyment of point and click adventures.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/260570/" rel="external">Gray Matter</a> gets 4 of 5 stars, only because of very slight control issues in a handful of scenes.</p>
