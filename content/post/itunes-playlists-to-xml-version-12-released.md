<div class="warning">
<p>This application has since been updated. <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Version 1.2 of iTunes Playlists to Xml is now ready for download.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_1.2.zip">Download iTunes Playlists to Xml version 1.2</a>.</p>
<p>This update should correct issues when the playlists are changed, as well as when the source is ejected.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately connecting to iTunes, the application now allows (and requires) that you manually begin that process.</p>
<p>To upgrade you need only replace/update&nbsp;iTunesApplication.exe with the one included in this zip. Otherwise, unzip the entire contents of zip into a directory, and run the executable.</p>
<p>Requires version 2.0&nbsp;of the .NET Framework.</p>
