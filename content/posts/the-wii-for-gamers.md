	&quot;Seriously considering purchasing a Wii (and only playing virtual console games)&quot; - <a href="http://twitter.com/strivinglife/status/1147123347">James Skemp</a>

In the February 2009 edition of GameInformer, they have an article titled &quot;Hardcore Gamer&#39;s Guide to the Wii.&quot; In that same issue, on the ratings page, there is one Wii game with an 8.5. The next highest is 8.25, followed by a number of 7.75s.
</p>
<p>
Since GameInformer is a magazine for gamers, I therefore make the claim that the article should have been titled &quot;Gamer&#39;s Guide to the Wii&quot; (note the missing word).
</p>
<p>
Clearly, when I spoke earlier, I wasn&#39;t joking; why would a gamer purchase a Wii, other than for the Virtual Console?
</p>
<p>
Looking at <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii/virtualconsole/games">the list of games</a>, I can find a number that make me recall my old systems (one of which was taken from me all too soon):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	Donkey Kong Country
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Secret of Mana
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>Super Mario 64</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Super Mario Bros. (1, 2, 3, and lost levels, which we had as one, but they&#39;ve done separately)
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Super Mario RPG
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Super Mario World
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Super Metroid
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then there&#39;s other games which I&#39;ve heard are good, or which I wouldn&#39;t mind playing again.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, some games are missing (Earthbound comes to mind immediately), but I can see a little over 15,000 Wii points waiting to be spent.
</p>
<p>
But, these are Virtual Console games, hence somewhat geared more towards older gamers, who grew up on these games. (Who else remembers Wal-Mart having a SNES with Super Mario World? How far along had someone gotten yours? Ours was to the last boss, but I don&#39;t think Star World was done. Heck, I just re-found my old game guide the other weekend for this game and a bunch of others.)
</p>
<p>
Is WiiWare the answer? Perhaps ... but it remains to be seen.
