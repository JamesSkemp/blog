      <title>Solar-powered desk fans?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With summer right around the corner, I&#39;ve been looking at solar powered fans, especially after seeing an episode of Ask This Old House where they installed an attic fan.&lt;!--adsense--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it looks it&#39;s extremely hard to find non-attic fans, in particular smaller models that might fit in a window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&#39;ve had such good luck with posting other items, I&#39;m hoping that someone will come upon this and have some suggestions for where one can either purchase a pre-built, solar-powered, desk fan, or a site that walks through the creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there&#39;s no storage, it would still be nice on those warm days to have a fan that isn&#39;t pulling an electrical current ...&lt;/p&gt;
