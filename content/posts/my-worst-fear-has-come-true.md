<p>Yes, that's right, my worst fear has come true. Not only did I get a girl pregnant, she also had my baby and is spelling my name wrong.</p>
<p>Or, when I signed up for something online, they must have thought that I have a child. Or, Mr. James Skamp had a child.</p>
<p>I guess my child is about 12 months old now - I don't know if it's walking yet though - but Huggies seems to think it's using diapers (hence the coupons).</p>
<p>I spoke with Jessie from Gerber, who was very fun to speak with, so I won't jest Gerber, but they're talking to me about Life Insurance for my little bundle.</p>
<p>But why, oh why, did the woman of one of my children spell my name wrong?</p>
