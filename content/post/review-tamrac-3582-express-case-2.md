<p>
I purchased one of these cases (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KMZSVO?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Tamrac 3582 Express Case 2</a>)&nbsp;for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R3OR8Q?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">Casio Exilim (EX-Z1200)</a> that I purchased at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
That camera fits this case *perfectly*, so my review may be a bit biased because of that :) 
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, this is a great little case. The padding provided is just the right amount that, the one time I dropped my camera, my heart didn&#39;t sink. (No surprise, the camera was fine.) 
</p>
<p>
However, the padding does make the camera a bit larger than it normally would be - approximately 1.5 cm. But, while this makes it a little larger for front and rear pockets, I&#39;ve had no problem putting this in pockets in the legs of shorts, nor in my various coats&#39; inner pockets. 
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t used the &#39;shoulder strap&#39; so I can&#39;t make any calls about it. However, it&#39;s a bit too thin for my tastes. The material is very well built - I&#39;ve been lugging it in coat/short pockets, and various bags, since February &#39;08, and it still looks like it did when I purchased it. 
</p>
<p>
All-in-all, if your camera will fit, I&#39;d highly recommend this case.
