<p>As <a href="/post/Interesting-feature-with-parsing-XML-with-jQuery-on-Safari.aspx">previously mentioned</a> I've been spending a good amount of time looking at HTML5/local storage in my free time.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, I ended up putting a number of items within <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xmlHtml/video_games.html">my video games offline application</a>, which is fine, but results in some extraneous information on the page.</p>
<p>To clean this up, as well as to allow for additional functionality, I've gone ahead and created a <a rel="external" href="http://media.jamesrskemp.com/AppManager.html">Web application manager</a> for my media.jamesrskemp.com Web site.</p>
<p>It has a pretty simple interface, and still requires some work, but I'm ultimately pretty happy with it.</p>
