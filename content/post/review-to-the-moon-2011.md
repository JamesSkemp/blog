<h3>Good story, but iffy controls</h3>

<p>From the reviews of this game I was expecting a short game with a good story. And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.</p>

<p>To the Moon did make me start to tear up at one point, as the game progresses from a man's old age to his youth, and you see what happened to bring him to where he was. </p>

<p>The art is good, the music is fantastic, but the controls leave a bit to be desired. I ended up playing the game with part mouse and part keyboard for movement, and quite frankly I still don't know which was better. Perhaps using a controller would have helped (if I even could; I didn't look). As mentioned above, the movement controls, and sometimes even the mouse selection, can be iffy.</p>

<p>While I understand it's built on top of an RPG Maker version, there's no real RPG elements, just point and click and minor puzzles.</p>

<p>But despite the minor issues, the game is recommended. 4 of 5 stars.</p>
