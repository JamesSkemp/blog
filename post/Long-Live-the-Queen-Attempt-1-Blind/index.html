        <p>Week 0</p><p>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: We're almost home. Your room is just the way you left it.<fast><br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: We're almost home. Your room is just the way you left it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I know it's hard to leave your school and all your friends, but I've arranged the best possible tutors for every subject.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll have to work hard this year to prepare yourself before your fifteenth birthday, but I know you can do it.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You'll learn quickly and you'll make a wonderful queen. It's what your mother would have wanted.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: This is not what Mother would have wanted!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wouldn't have wanted to die and leave me.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No. She wouldn't. But sometimes bad things happen. We have to pick up and carry on.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All of Nova depends on us. On you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: *sigh*<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I will be here to guide you until your coronation, but the decisions you make are ultimately up to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Come. Your maids are waiting.<br> Welcome to <b>Long Live The Queen!</b> If this is your first time playing, you should read this brief introduction to how the game works.<br>Menu: [Tell me more] [I've played this before] <br>Player chose: Tell me more<br> You will be controlling Elodie, the almost-Queen of Nova, as she tries to prepare for her coronation. To do that, she needs to take classes every week in order to raise her <b>Skills.</b><br> The skills she learns will provide different choices in the ongoing plot. Learning the right skills can mean the difference between life and death!<br> You also need to keep an eye on Elodie's <b>Mood.</b> With her mother's tragic death, Elodie is not very happy right now. The Mood button will take you to the emotions screen for more details.<br> Elodie is feeling both <b>Afraid</b> and <b>Depressed</b>, but her strongest emotion is Depressed. If she becomes more Cheerful to cancel out the depression, her strongest emotion would then be Afraid.<br> Elodie's current mood affects her ability to learn. It will give her a bonus to some skills and a penalty to others. Let's take a look at the Skills screen now.<br> Skills are broken into four main categories - Social, Physical, Intellectual, and Mystical. Inside these categories are skillsets, groups of three related skills. You start with 0 in all skills.<br> Every week, Elodie can study two skills. Normally, she earns 2 points in a skill for every weekday that she studies. So if she studies History, she will earn <b>2 points x 5 days = 10 points.</b><br> Because Elodie is depressed, she has a <b>-2</b> penalty to the Social skillset <b>Conversation.</b> She doesn't feel like talking to people right now. If she studies Conversation, she will earn <b>2 - 2 points per day</b>: that is, <b>0 points!</b><br> However, she has a <b>+1</b> bonus to the <b>Expression</b> skillset. If she studies one of the Expression skills, she will earn <b>2 + 1 points per day</b>. Which means 3 points a day, 15 points for the week.<br> If you study a skill you have a penalty for, you could be wasting your time and not learning anything. If you study a skill you have bonuses for, you will learn much faster than normal.<br> All of these bonuses and penalties will change when Elodie's mood changes. She can also gain bonuses to skills by studying related skills. Check the skills screen every week to see your current bonuses!<br> Once you know your mood, skills, bonuses, and penalties, you are ready to choose your classes for the week.<br> The classes screen breaks down skillsets by category for your Morning and Evening classes. When you select a skillset, the three options in that set will appear on the right side of the screen.<br> Choose a class option for both Morning and Evening classes, then click the 'Done' button which will appear in the lower-right corner.<br> As you play through the story, you will sometimes see feedback bubbles appearing over the text. These tell you what's happening behind the scenes.<br> Bubbles like these will show you when Elodie's mood is being altered by events.<br> Bubbles like these will show you when the story is changing based on what skills Elodie has learned so far. If the test fails, there is some option being missed because she doesn't have enough points in that skill yet.<br> This feedback is very helpful in figuring out different options to try! But if you don't want to see it, you can turn the bubbles off in the Preferences menu.<br> Now, get ready to become a Queen!<br>(Put on the boarding_school outfit.)</p><hr><p>Week 1</p><p>(Studied Decoration in the morning.)<br>(Studied Horses in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's all that noise outside? Who's here?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! It's my cousins! And my aunt and uncle.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: Darling. We were so terribly sorry to hear about your mother Fidelia.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Laurent, Duke of Merva: You look well, niece.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Hi, 'Lodie!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Hi, Lottie. I haven't seen you in ages! Will you be staying long?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Yup! Mummy said we'd be here all month.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe we'll have some time to talk later.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I love this room! It's so much bigger than mine back home.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You should visit more often. It's awful that the only time I get to see you is...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ... something like this.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I know your brother and sister are still too young, but why haven't you come to school?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: My mother worries about me. She doesn't think anywhere but home is safe.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I understand. I'm probably not going to be allowed to leave this castle until my birthday.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But at least we can have fun together here!<br><hr>Week 2<br><br>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's that commotion outside? Father? What's going on?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I have come to pay my respects in honor of your mother.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You have no respect or honor. It's because of you and your powers that my wife is dead!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?!?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I am a Lumen, as was she, and like every Lumen I am willing to give my life if necessary to protect our domain. <br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Your line has been traitors for two hundred years. I won't have you corrupting my daughter.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: That is for the Crown Princess to decide.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Elodie, your mother trusted me, and I have much to teach you.<br>Menu: [Send her away] [Arrest her] [Let her stay] <br>Player chose: Let her stay<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I want to hear what she has to say.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She stays.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What is it you wanted to teach me?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: First, I need to know if you have your mother's crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The source of power for any Lumen is a particular magical crystal. Once you've bonded with it, it becomes a part of you as long as you live.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The Royal Crystal has been passed down from ruler to ruler for generations. It belongs to you, now - except that the King may be keeping it from you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Do you have a crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Of course.<br> She holds out her hands. Light flickers above her bosom, and then, with a shower of sparkles, something takes shape.<br> You reach out to touch it, and it dissolves away into nothing.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It belongs to me. No one can take it from me until I die.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You need to find the crystal that belongs to you.<br><hr>Week 3<br><br>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br> You may now play Sports on the weekends.<br>(Studied Divination in the afternoon.)<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: He loves me, he loves me not...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie, do you have a boyfriend?<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: Not really. I just like to play with the flowers.<br> All of a sudden, the Duchess of Ursul rushes into the garden and points a sword at you!<br> No, not at you. At your... feet?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Princess! Don't move!<br>Menu: [Hold still] [Look down] <br>Player chose: Hold still<br> You want to hold still, but you don't have the composure to hold your position without peeking.<br> You look down where her sword is pointing.<br> There's a <b>snake</b> in the grass!<br> You can't help it - you squeak and jump back. The snake tenses and prepares to strike.<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: No!<br> Your cousin pushes you aside, and the snake's fangs sink into her leg.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Lottie!<br> Too late, Julianna swings her sword and cuts off the snake's head.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: What is going on out here?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your daughter's been bitten by a milk viper. They're poisonous. Get an herbalist, right away!<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: <b>I</b> will treat my daughter. I certainly can't trust anyone here to keep her safe!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm sorry...<br>Charlotte, Lady Merva: I don't feel good.<br>Lucille, Countess of Nix: We will be returning home to Merva immediately.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your aunt has a point. Milk vipers are not native to this area. That snake should never have been here.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Someone may have tried to kill you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Will Charlotte be okay?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: I don't know.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 4<br><br>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br>(Studied Meditation in the afternoon.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The castle seems quieter with Charlotte and Emry and Zahra and their parents gone.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It's certainly not empty, though. It seems like we get more servants every day.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I was so worried about Charlotte, after that snake bit her...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But her mother said she's okay, so I guess it turned out all right.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Maybe she has a guardian angel!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How do I find my Lumen crystal?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Your father probably knows what happened to it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What if he destroyed it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: They can't be destroyed. He could throw it away, but then someone else might find it. No, he'll keep it safe.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But if it's mine, it wouldn't matter if someone else found it.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: It's attuned to you, but you haven't bonded with it yet. If it found a compatible host, someone who was <i>like</i> you in some way, it could bond to them.<br><hr>Week 5<br><br>(Studied Reflexes in the morning.)<br> Your skill in Reflexes is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Agility skills are 25 or higher.<br>(Studied Lore in the afternoon.)<br> One of the maids approaches for your attention.<br>Alice: My lady, couriers have arrived from the Duke of Sedna.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We have a Duke of Sedna?<br>Alice: ... No, my Lady. The duchy of Sedna is in Talasse.<br>Alice: They have brought you a letter, and a gift.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: 'Condolences on the death of', 'deeply regret', 'best wishes'...<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Oh! What a beautiful necklace!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Something sparkly will make me feel better.<br> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br><hr>Week 6<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Strategy in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking, you spot a familiar figure in the palace gardens.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's the Duchess of Ursul! Maybe I should go and say hello.)<br> Then you notice that seated beside her is a woman in the robes of a priestess. They are very close together, their hands gently touching as they speak.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Looks like she's busy!)<br> You turn and walk in a different direction, so as not to disturb them. At that moment, you notice something unusual. It looks like someone just left the palace grounds by going over the hedge.<br> Was that a servant? A thief? Or... an assassin?<br>Menu: [Climb up to look over the hedge] [Call the guards] [Run and hide] <br>Player chose: Call the guards<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Guards!<br> However, by the time the response is organised and directed to the area beyond the palace, there's no sign of any intruder.<br> You wonder if you were only imagining it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Dad, what happened to Mom's Lumen crystal?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It's in a safe place.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Can I have it?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: No.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: But it's mine!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Meddling with magic killed your mother. I don't want that to happen to you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Once you're crowned Queen, I can't stop you from doing anything you want, but for now you are still a child.<br><hr>Week 7<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking up the stairs, a maid comes running down holding a towering pile of linen.<br> You swiftly step aside and let her pass.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: My father says I can't have the crystal until I'm Queen, so we'll just have to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: There may not be time to wait.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: This world is filled with dangers, and you will need the powers of a Lumen to fight them. You can't begin training until you have bonded with your crystal.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what else am I supposed to do about it?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The crystal is probably held under guard in the Royal Treasury. You are the princess; you should be able to find a way inside.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Otherwise we might have to take drastic action.<br>Menu: [I'll wait until I'm older] [I'll try to find a way] [What drastic action?] <br>Player chose: What drastic action?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean by drastic action?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Try to reach the crystal. If you can't, come and talk to me again.<br><hr>Week 8<br><br>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a man here to see you. He wishes Crown funding for a project of his.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember, the treasury is not unlimited. If you choose to invest, you will have less money to work with later.<br>Man: Your Royal Highness, I have a plan to print books using metal letters which can be moved and reused.<br>Man: I need to borrow 875 lassi to assemble the metal and a factory to mold and cast the type.<br>Man: With this system, we will be able to create new books in a fraction of the time it takes now, and make copies to send all over the world.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know much about factories or trade. Would that really be worthwhile?)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 9<br><br>(Studied Court Manners in the morning.)<br>(Studied Ciphering in the afternoon.)<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, my sympathies for your loss. Even after all these years I sometimes forget that my own mother will never be coming back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: However, I must call for your aid. The Ixionite occupation of the county of Imbrium has gone on for too long. Now is the time to push back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I know there's been some problems with Ixion, but I don't know the details. I guess they're occupying southern Maree.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (We have plenty of troops, so it shouldn't be that hard to drive them out, if we want to make a fight of it.)<br>Menu: [Try to negotiate] [Prepare for battle] <br>Player chose: Try to negotiate<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<fast><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There must be a peaceful way to settle this. I will send for diplomats from Ixion and try to come to some arrangement.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Thank you, Your Highness.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Your Highness, if I may ask... That necklace you're wearing. Where did it come from?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: It was a gift from the Duke of Sedna.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Then, you have made arrangements with him?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I think he's asking if I'm engaged to the Duke!)<br>Menu: [I'm considering it] [I just like jewelry] <br>Player chose: I'm considering it<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No arrangements yet, but I look upon him fondly.<fast><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No arrangements yet, but I look upon him fondly.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I see. Your happiness is my utmost concern, Your Highness.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 10<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The representative from Ixion is here. Be careful - no one wants to give up prizes that they have won.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: You have the full support of my sister and myself, Your Highness.<br>Brin, Duchess of Hellas, Countess of Dysnomia: Hmph. Let's get this over with.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Your Royal Highness, thank you for granting me this audience. I am sure we can come to an amicable agreement.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: Let bygones be bygones, no? We will forget about your unprovoked attacks on us, and you will transfer the rights to this little province.<br>Diplomat from Ixion: We can be good neighbors again, without any lives being lost.<br>Menu: [Surrender Province] [Offer him money if Ixion withdraws] [Bluff / Intimidate] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Bluff / Intimidate<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You are trespassing on our lands. You will withdraw your troops at once. Only then will we have peace.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hmm. This necklace I'm wearing might convince him that we are already allied with Duke Sedna in the domain of Talasse.)<br>Menu: [Threaten to attack] [Claim you are allied with Talasse] <br>Player chose: Claim you are allied with Talasse<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: As you can see, I already have allies. Do you really want to face both Nova and Talasse?<br>Diplomat from Ixion: ... Perhaps not.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Yes! I won!)<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 11<br><br>(Studied Logistics in the morning.)<br>(Studied Ciphering in the afternoon.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There are reports that a keythong has been sighted leaving the Old Forest.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What's a keythong?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: A beast with the body of an enormous golden cat, a sharp beak, and spikes on its back.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Eek!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Several disappearances in southern Caloris are already thought to be the work of this creature.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do we do? Should we send hunters?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The traditional policy on stray beasts is to hope that they return to the forest and stay there.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Hunters are no match for such creatures. You would only make it angry and waste more lives.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: So... we just let it eat people?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Everyone dies in the end.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Also, there is a letter for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Talarist, the Duke of Sedna, will be arriving next week for an official visit.)<br> You wander through the parts of the castle where other people rarely visit, but find little except spiderwebs. Yuck.<br>(Put on the intrigue outfit.): (Put on the boarding_school outfit.)<br><hr>Week 12<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br> You may now tour the Barracks on the weekends.
Your skill in Strategy is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Military skills are 25 or higher.<br>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: Ah, Your Highness. What a pleasure it is to meet you in person at last. Your description did not do you justice.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: *giggle*<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know how to deal with handsome older men paying me compliments!)<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: I was so pleased to hear that you had accepted my humble offering. A jewel for a jewel - but you are the more precious.<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: I hope that this is only the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. A union between us would bring stability to both our peoples.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (He really does want to marry me!)<br>Menu: [Accept his offer] [Politely decline] <br>Player chose: Politely decline<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I need to let him down gently.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I am <b>not</b> marrying you! I'm only fourteen!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (... That may not have been gentle.)<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: I am aware of your youth, my princess. That is the only reason that our domains are not already at war.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: You told the representative from Ixion that my domain was allied to yours. My king was quite suprised to hear of it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Er.<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: You are unprepared for the realities of politics. Marry me, and I will be your guide, your protector and your advisor.<br>Menu: [All right, I'll marry you] [I still won't marry you] <br>Player chose: I still won't marry you<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I won't do it! I won't, I won't, I won't!<br>Talarist, Duke of Sedna: ... I see.<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br><hr>Week 13<br><br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the morning.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>(Studied Foreign Intelligence in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A woman has been convicted of attempted murder and requests the mercy of the Crown.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Your Highness! This slattern dares to beg pardon, when she <b>admits</b> that she tried to poison my sister under her own roof!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Which sister?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Corisande, the Duchess of Mead.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Is she all right?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: She is unharmed. We caught the culprit in the kitchens before anyone could eat her foul spew.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?<br>Condemned Woman: It's justice, it is! Them devils killed me brother, and broke me mam's heart.<br>Condemned Woman: Lied to her, they did, when she went to see why he'd not come back. Said he'd gone for a soldier, when he never would!<br>Condemned Woman: He weren't the only one neither. I waited ten years for my chance to get my own back. That's justice!<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: You see? She's completely unrepentant! Hang her and be done with it.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hmm. This might have something to do with the last Duke of Mead. He was involved in all sorts of scandals.)<br>Menu: [Put her to work] [Imprison her] [Execute her] [Ask the Earl of Io about her story] <br>Player chose: Ask the Earl of Io about her story<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I need to know if she has any justification for her actions.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: <i>Did</i> the old Duke kill her brother?<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: Are you <i>accusing</i> my family?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I'm asking what happened!<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: The honor of our line is far greater than that of the wet-bottomed child who sits the throne!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br> Without warning, the Earl of Io draws a dagger and slices the convict's throat.<br>Kevan, Earl of Io: No one harms my family. No one!<br> He throws the blood-stained blade to the floor and walks away.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Ooooo!<br> Sitting in on court sessions is not fun at all, but it pleases your father and it may be important for your future.<br>(Put on the military outfit.)<br><hr>Week 14<br><br>(Studied Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br> As you are walking one day in the gardens, you hear a strange sound and look up to see an owl flying overhead. A single dry leaf flutters in its talons.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's funny, I thought owls were nocturnal. I guess I was wrong.)<br> When you return to the castle, your father is waiting for you.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She wishes Crown funding for a project.<br>Woman: Thank you for seeing me, Your Royal Highness. I... I come to you on behalf of the people.<br>Woman: I wish to build a hospital where any citizen afflicted with disease can be brought for treatment.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Putting all the sick people together? Wouldn't that make them die even faster?)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: We are not interested.<br> You wander through the parts of the castle where other people rarely visit, but find little except spiderwebs. Yuck.<br><hr>Week 15<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Remember that the Festival of the Good Lady is approaching.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There will be public celebrations for the commoners, followed by a grand gala for the nobility.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A grand ball... There will be dancing.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you would be expected to lead the procession and take part in the ceremonial planting, possibly give a speech.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: However, since you are not yet crowned, it is not required, and it may not be safe to expose you to the public.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do you mean, not safe?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Outside of the castle, you are less well protected. If anyone means you harm... Think on it now, decide later.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a letter for you as well.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's from Briony! I went to school with her, but she's a couple years older than me. Her mother is the Duchess of Mead.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's complaining that her mother still won't let her come home for the holidays.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Apparently her uncle Kevan is absolutely furious about that woman's trial.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's bored and looking for an adventure. Well, I don't have any to suggest to her!)<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 16<br><br>(Studied Public Speaking in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Today is the procession and planting for the Festival of the Good Lady. Will you be leading the parade?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: If you have any concerns about your safety, please, stay here.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The people will recover from disappointment; if we lose you, there is no recovery.<br>Menu: [I will lead the parade] [I will parade and make a speech] [I would rather not go] <br>Player chose: I would rather not go<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No... I guess I'd rather stay here.<br> You watch the procession from your tower window, feeling safe but lonely.<br> Suddenly, you hear someone moving around inside your room. You turn in surprise, but it's only a maid.<br>Alice: My lady? What are you - Should you not be in the procession?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's a major festival, but there are other ways to celebrate.)<br>Menu: [Confess your fears] [Yell at her] [Make religious excuse] <br>Player chose: Confess your fears<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I can't go outside... there might be assassins.<fast><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I can't go outside... there might be assassins.<br>Alice: Oh.<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 17<br><br>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Are you ready for the grand ball?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: All the nobles in the domain are here to see you - to see their queen.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (gulp!)<br> You finish dressing and descend the stairs to make a grand entrance.<br> All around, the rich and powerful pause in their activities to gaze upon you, the ruler of them all.<br> Seeing yourself reflected in so many eyes makes you want to run away and hide.<br> After a moment, you force yourself to carry on, but you're sure they've all seen you hesitate.<br> Your father waits for you at the bottom of the stairs and offers you his arm.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The first dance is for us.<br> He guides you gently around the dance floor, never rushing you. It's fun to dance with your father, but the look in his eyes is so sad.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: After this, you must choose your own partner. There are a number of men who hope to catch your eye.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Duke of Kigal alone has brought three eligible sons, all near your age.<br> You look around the room at all your possible partners - which is to say, everyone. No one may begin dancing until you do. You can pick whomever you want and you will not be denied.<br>Menu: [Someone about your age] [Someone younger than you] [Someone older than you] [Someone already married] [Someone scandalous] <br>Player chose: Someone older than you<br> You look around for a likely candidate, and your eye settles on Chaine, the Earl of Mima. He's almost ten years older than you are and quite good-looking, so why not enjoy yourself?<br> He smiles brightly at your approach and you begin to dance.<br> Dancing with a real partner feels quite different from dancing with your father. You knew him, knew his steps like a part of you. Now every move is a mystery.<br> Unfortunately, you lose track of which steps you're supposed to do when, and trip over your own feet. Oops!<br> Between the dances, there is time for the guests to mingle, chat, and sample tiny bites of exquisite food.<br> During a lull in the music, Banion, the duke of Maree, taps an elegant fingernail against a wineglass, letting the clear note ring out through the room.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: If I might have your attention?<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: I believe we should offer our compliments to our lovely hostess.<br>Banion, Duke of Maree, Earl of Serenitatis: Her words of wisdom guide us through our difficulties.<br> Everyone applauds politely.<br> As the gala continues, you take the opportunity to observe nobles that you rarely see.<br> There's Gwenelle, for instance - the Young Lady of Sudbury, only months older than you and due to finally inherit control of her duchy soon.<br> Or Adele, the youngest daughter of the Duchess of Lillah and a fierce sportswoman. She was a few years ahead of you at school and the absolute terror of the ballfields.<br> No Briony - she had said her parents were leaving her stuck at school this season.<br> Her parents are here, dancing together - the Duke-Consort clutching his Duchess possessively tight.<br> Strange that there's no sign of your cousins, though. Shouldn't they be here?<br> Your aunt and uncle <i>are</i> here, of course. It would be scandalous if they hadn't come, Merva being so close by.<br> It's nice to be able to enjoy time with friends and family, isn't it?<br> You pay your respects to your mother's tomb, and wonder if the same fate is waiting for you.<br><hr>Week 18<br><br>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Production in the afternoon.)<br> You wander downstairs to visit your father and talk about the latest events in the domain.<br> You're moving with such enthusiasm that you don't realise your father isn't alone until it's too late to avoid him and his... companion.<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: You are too kind, Joslyn.<br> Countess Sirin. <i>Not</i> a member of your circles - she's a bit more than a decade your senior, far too old to have ever been your friend. And yet, not at all old, as noblewomen go.<br> She has two minor titles, no husband, and <i>your father's arm in her grasp.</i><br> How <i>dare</i> she make a move on your father?<br>Menu: [Shame her with silent scorn] [Insult her with false flattery] [Trip her as she passes] <br>Player chose: Trip her as she passes<br> You wait until the Countess gets closer, then hook your foot around to make her stumble.<br> Unfortunately, you get your feet tangled up and end up tripping <i>yourself,</i> falling to the ground with a thud.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Elodie, are you all right?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: ...<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: Oh, dear. She does need a bit of looking after, doesn't she?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Not by you!)<br>Sirin, Countess of Miranda and Callisto: I should go now. I hope to see more of you later.<br> Once she's gone, you raise an eyebrow at your father.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Don't give me that look, young lady. She's a nice woman, nothing more.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: She wants something more!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: And it's not going to happen any time soon.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You should be careful how you deal with people like Sirin. You need the goodwill of your nobles as well as your commoners.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: There haven't been any problems so far.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Many dark looks were aimed your way at the gala.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As Queen, you must be aware of everything around you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Isn't that what I have agents for?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Yes, but you must give them direction. What is your greatest concern?<br>Menu: [Noble plots] [Commoner uprisings] [Foreign threats] [Assassins] <br>Player chose: Foreign threats<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I need to know if any foreign powers are moving against me.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You try to talk your way past the treasury guards, but despite eyelash-fluttering, foot-stomping, and outright threats, they won't budge. Hmph!<br><hr>Week 19<br><br>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Accounting in the afternoon.)<br> Your skill in Accounting is now 50.  You may not increase this skill until your other Economics skills are 25 or higher.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: It is the time of year to decide any necessary adjustments to the royal budget.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The majority of the money we receive is already spoken for, but there is always some room for discretion.<br> Based on the records and notes of current expenditures, if you maintain the current rate of tax, you will still have nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four gold lassi and ninety-seven silver tilassi available for special projects.<br> You can't imagine any reason that you would need to spend so much. You could afford to lower taxes.<br> Four thousand lassi should be enough to cover any military surprises for the rest of the year.<br>Menu: [Raise taxes] [Keep them the same] [Lower taxes] <br>Player chose: Keep them the same<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I think they're fine as they are.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You wander through the parts of the castle where other people rarely visit, but find little except spiderwebs. Yuck.<br><hr>Week 20<br><br>(Studied Presence in the morning.)<br>(Studied Trade in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You are requested to stand in judgement. A man has been convicted of the murder-by-strangling of his wife.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He does not deny the act, but requests a pardon that he might be set free.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: If you admit you killed your wife, why do you think I'm going to set you free?<br>Condemned Man: Save me, Your Majesty! Wasn't my fault. <i>Demons</i> made me do it.<br>Condemned Man: Everyone knows the power of magical beasties! They used me, they twisted my fingers into chains...<br>Condemned Man: My wife found me screaming, she tried to shake me, and the chains wrapped around her...<br>Condemned Man: I need the priestesses to bless me and make me clean again!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Demons that make you attack people? Is that even possible?)<br>Menu: [Pardon him] [Imprison him] [Execute him] <br>Player chose: Execute him<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't care whether there were demons or not, you're still a murderer and your life is forfeit.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: You will be hanged in public as a deterrent to future criminals.<br> He opens his mouth to argue with you further, but then his shoulders slump.<br>Condemned Man: Yes, Your Majesty.<br> Afterwards, you receive a report from your agents near the Talassian border. There is unusual activity going on in the duchy of Sedna. Official messengers have been coming and going between the Sedna customs stations.<br> Is Duke Talarist planning to disrupt trade between Sedna and Elath? Or is this a sign of something worse?<br>Menu: [Send soldiers to the border] [Do nothing] <br>Player chose: Send soldiers to the border<br> You detach a battalion of soldiers to guard the border between Sedna and Elath. If he tries anything, you'll be prepared.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: You have not yet reached the crystal. Are you making progress, or is it time for another plan?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That would probably be the 'drastic action' she mentioned earlier.)<br>Menu: [Leave it to me] [Take drastic action] <br>Player chose: Take drastic action<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I suppose... I'll have to listen to another plan.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Leave it to me.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Fine.<br> ...<br> That night, an explosion rocks the castle. A section of stone near the Royal Treasury collapses, crushing the guards on duty.<br> Nothing is stolen... at least, nothing that is acknowledged publicly.<br> But when you look at your father's face, you can see it in his eyes: the crystal is gone, and he knows that you are to blame. He will never trust you the same way again.<br><hr>Week 21<br><br>(Studied Internal Affairs in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br> You receive word of an unfortunate incident at the gallows where the man you judged was sent to be executed.<br> As he was led to the platform, he suddenly lashed out with explosive magical power, killing several guards and spectators before making his escape.<br> The population is buzzing with rumors of a secret cabal of evil Lumens who sacrifice innocents in their dark rituals.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Do you have it? You do have it, don't you?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The crystal? Of course. Everything is ready for you.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Right.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Did you really have to kill the guards?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: If you regret their sacrifice, then do not let it go to waste.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It's too late to turn back now. I have to do the best I can for my people.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What do I do?<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: Pick up the crystal with your bare hands. Press it against your chest, over your heart, and say <i>"Illuminate!"</i><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Okay... Here we go... 
 Illuminate!<br> You feel dizzy, and both larger and lighter than you were before. The crystal has disappeared from view, but <i>you</i> know where it is.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Wow.<br>Julianna, Duchess of Ursul: The priestess here is a friend of mine. I will come to your lessons in the faith and train you to use your powers.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I should feel happy, I guess... I'm a Lumen now. I just hope I'm doing the right thing.)<br> The game will now attempt to save the log and open it in a web browser.<br>Menu: [Continue] [Cancel] <br>Player chose: Cancel<br><hr>Week 22<br><br>(Studied Ciphering in the morning.)<br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I regret to inform you that Fabian, the Earl of Titan and Duke-Regent of Elath, has passed away.<br> This isn't really a surprise; he was pretty old. The problem is the political implications.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: With the control of Elath in doubt, it falls to the crown to make decisions.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Young Lord Adair will not reach his fifteenth birthday for over two years. He requires a regent.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: His stepmother, Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, has petitioned that the boy be left in her care.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This would, however, leave her in personal control of two neighboring duchies, which is generally forbidden.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Almost the entire eastern border.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (I don't know anything really <i>bad</i> about her, though...)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The boy does have a living grandfather, the Earl of Ishtar. Or you might appoint an unrelated noble to act in his stead.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The Earl of Ishtar has suggested another possibility. You and Adair are both young, not too far apart in age.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He requests that we accept the boy as your future husband and keep him here at the castle.<br>Menu: [Leave him with Arisse] [Send him to his grandfather] [Marry him] [Send him to your uncle] <br>Player chose: Send him to his grandfather<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: The Earl of Ishtar is the closest blood relation that Adair has. He should be regent.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: As you wish.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 23<br><br>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br>(Studied Logistics in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: There is a woman here to see you. She is a musician and wishes Crown patronage.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Which means money.)<br>Sabine: Your Royal Highness! If you accept me as a member of your court I will immortalise you in word and song.<br>Sabine: I have dabbled in musical styles from many countries, and can entertain your guests and lighten your evenings.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Musicians are often used as secret agents and messengers. They can be useful - and dangerous.)<br> The musician sings a little ditty to demonstrate her skills with the lute.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She's actually pretty good.)<br>Menu: [Accept her as Court Musician] [Reject her] <br>Player chose: Reject her<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Thank you, but we are not interested.<br> You spend the weekend holed up alone in your room with your favorite toys.  It's childish, but you feel a bit better.<br><hr>Week 24<br><br>(Studied Lore in the morning.)<br> You have unlocked a new outfit!
<br>(Studied Ciphering in the afternoon.)<br> You receive a letter from Young Lord Adair.<br> It's an extremely formal letter for such a little boy, thanking you for your wisdom in allowing him to live with his grandfather (who probably dictated every word he wrote).<br> You try to explain to the guards that you need to visit the treasury in order to get an accurate report on the domain's finances. They waver slightly, but in the end, they stand by your father's commands.<br>(Put on the faith outfit.): (Put on the intrigue outfit.): (Put on the military outfit.)<br><hr>Week 25<br><br>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br>(Studied Sense Magic in the afternoon.)<br> Your agents report a buildup of military strength - particularly warships - in Shanjia, the major power across the ocean to the west. They may be intending to go on the attack.<br> Shanjia lies a great distance from Nova. You have few diplomatic ties and no known conflicts. There's no reason to assume that you would be their target.<br> Still, if they send a fleet across the ocean, Nova might be in danger. At the very least, shipping would be disrupted.<br> It takes time to assemble worthy vessels, and you have advance warning. You could make your own preparations to defend your coast.<br> The downside is, they won't come cheap.<br>Menu: [Build more warships] [Do nothing] <br>Player chose: Build more warships<br> You send orders for the assembly of new ships, and the strengthening of weaponry and cladding on the existing fleet. If trouble comes, you'll be ready for it.<br> You attend services in the castle grove, letting the peace of the ritual calm your heart.<br><hr>Week 26<br><br>(Studied Naval Strategy in the morning.)<br>(Studied Wield Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I have unpleasant news to report.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Adair, the Young Lord of Elath, has been assassinated.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: What?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: He was shot with a crossbow while playing on the grounds of his grandfather's estate.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: How did this happen? Where were the guards?<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: This is not the first time such events have happened within the realm of Ishtar.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (The Earl of Ishtar's first wife and oldest daughter also died under mysterious circumstances.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Officially, an accident, but there were rumors it was agents from Talasse.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Then his other daughter married young and died giving birth to Adair.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (With Adair dead, the only family he has left is his second wife and their son Connor, who's fifteen.)<br>Menu: [Blame the Earl of Ishtar] [Blame Talasse] [Blame no one] <br>Player chose: Blame no one<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: No matter what we do, things keep going wrong.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Then there is the matter of the duchy of Elath.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: By blood, the nearest living heir is Talarist, the Duke of Sedna.... in Talasse.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A long time ago there were marriages between the leaders of Elath and Sedna. That's his ancestry.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (But the people of Elath did not want a Duke of foreign blood. There were revolts.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (The title of Duke of Elath was passed to a distant relative instead of Talarist's ancestor.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Elath is a major duchy. You cannot afford to lose control of it.<br>Menu: [Name a Novan heir] [Name Talarist the heir] [Delay] <br>Player chose: Name a Novan heir<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: As Queen, I have the right to pass the lands of an extinct bloodline to a new ruler.<fast><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: As Queen, I have the right to pass the lands of an extinct bloodline to a new ruler.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Like my mother did with Uncle Laurent and Merva.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Talarist is only <i>distantly</i> related, and he's foreign. He doesn't count.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Who should inherit the duchy of Elath, then?<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Hmm. There are a few noble families with a lot of children, too many to inherit all the existing titles.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Arisse, the Duchess of Lillah, has six children. The oldest three all have lands already.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's Kevan, the Earl of Io, Corisande, the Duchess of Mead, and Charmion, the Duchess-Consort of Kigal.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That leaves three others who are all a few years older than me.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (The Duke and Duchess of Kigal have <i>seven</i> children, three around my age and four younger.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (And they're all Arisse's grandchildren through their mother. So either way, it would be her line.)<br>Menu: [A child of the Duke of Kigal] [A child of the Duchess of Lillah] [An administrator from Elath] [A random commoner!] <br>Player chose: A random commoner!<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: I don't know, pick someone! Pick anyone from Elath! I don't care!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Very well.<br> You sneak a peek at some of the luckless peasants held in the dungeons - petty thieves and troublemakers, now suffering in the dark. They're obviously bad people, but seeing them so miserable still feels unfair. There must be a better way.<br><hr>Week 27<br><br>(Studied Resist Magic in the morning.)<br>(Studied Sense Magic in the afternoon.)<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: I have more unpleasant news.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: Soldiers belonging to the Duke of Sedna have attempted to cross the border into Elath, but were chased off by your patrols.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: Good thing I put soldiers there earlier!<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: The crisis is averted for now, but relations with Talasse are likely to be strained in the future.<br>Joslyn, King Dowager, Duke of Caloris: You also have some letters.<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Another letter from Briony. Why does she keep writing me? We were never even friends.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (She says she's bored and lonely and she's looking forward to seeing me at Gwenelle's birthday party.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (That's right! Gwenelle is about to turn fifteen! She'll be Duchess of Sudbury for real now.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (This other letter must be my invitation to her birthday celebration next week.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (Gwenelle and I were friends at school, and this will be a big event, but it's also a long way to travel.)<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (A lot of things can happen on the road.)<br>Menu: [Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party] [Send your regrets] <br>Player chose: Go to Sudbury for Gwenelle's party<br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It'll be good to see my friends!)<fast><br>Elodie, Crown Princess: (It'll be good to see my friends!)<br> You take to the court for a few games of tennis. Feel the thrill of competition!<br><hr>Week 28<br><br>(Studied Divination in the morning.)<br>(Studied Wield Magic in the afternoon.)<br> On your journey to Sudbury, your carriage is attacked by bandits!<br> You look down in shock at the arrow which has buried itself in your side. Outside, you can hear screams and curses, but it feels unreal. Your world is centered around pain.<br> You struggle with the arrow, afraid to pull it loose. You heard a story somewhere about pushing arrows through the body, so you brace yourself and give it a shove.<br> Unfortunately, this only drives the arrow deeper into your vital organs, turning a painful wound into a fatal one.<br>Elodie did not survive to reach her coronation.  Nova would have to go on without her.</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!<br></fast></fast></fast></fast></fast></fast></p>
