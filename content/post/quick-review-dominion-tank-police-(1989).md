<p>
I watched Dominion Tank Police this evening, from Netflix. It&#39;s four acts, each consisting of about 35 to 40 minutes of movie (which includes approximately 1 1/2 minutes of opening and ending credits.

<p>
What really attracted me to the movie was Masamune Shirow, who created not only this series, but also Appleseed (the newer one is more interesting than the original), Black Magic M-66 (which I haven&#39;t yet seen) and Ghost in the Shell (great movies and interesting shows).

All-in-all, I couldn&#39;t recommend Tank Police to someone that hasn&#39;t seen a movie in this genre before. However, if you&#39;d seen a dozen or so of these previously, it&#39;s an interesting enough film, albeit a bit silly at times.<br />

Unfortunately, the movie ends somewhat open, and rather confusingly at that. But, I think we can make some assumptions about what happened to one of the characters, as well as how the rest of the characters continue on.

I rated Dominion Tank Police four of five stars.&nbsp;
