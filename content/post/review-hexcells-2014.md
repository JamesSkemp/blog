<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of Hexcells (2014), played on the PC.</p></div>

<h3>A short, but enjoyable, puzzle game</h3>

<p>Ultimately, I recommend <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890" rel="external">Hexcells</a>, especially for the price I paid ($1.25 with the standalone expansion), as I got a around 110 minutes of play.</p>

<p>It's a pretty basic puzzle game, with some extra dynamics added in as you progress. I do wish that the puzzles were a little more complex, but I also tend to enjoy this type of game, so the general idea wasn't new to me. Still, as I said, enjoyable.</p>
