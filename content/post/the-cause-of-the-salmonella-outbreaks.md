If you listen to the news media, salmonella outbreaks are on a rampage. Spinach, cantaloupe, and now peanut butter. Unfortunately, the cause of these isn&#39;t being investigated successfully. The cause, and on Prince Harry:<!--more-->

It&#39;s refreshing to hear that Prince Harry will be heading over to Iraq. In a country where some of our leaders are willing to send children off to war, so long as they are not their own, it&#39;s great to see a country where a leader&#39;s child is going off to war. Of course, it also shows that, if he were to become leader, Prince Harry may just be one of the best.

As for salmonella, while some are thinking of terrorists only when it comes to Iraq, it&#39;s time to remember our southern neighbor. Could Mexican-based terrorists be the cause of the salmonella outbreaks? I&#39;m not the first to suggest it ...
