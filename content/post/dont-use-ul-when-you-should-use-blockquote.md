<p>
I&#39;m sorry, but I hate it when people use &lt;ul&gt; instead of &lt;blockquote&gt;.  &lt;ul&gt; is for list items, and should therefore be composed of list items (&lt;li&gt;s). If you&#39;re not going to put &lt;li&gt;s for each item within a &lt;ul&gt; block, <strong>don&#39;t use &lt;ul&gt;</strong><!--more--><!--adsense-->
