<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VO4TX8?tag=strivinglifen-20">Nady Audio Stereo Headphones, model HP-03</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>I received a pair of these headphones in a bundle, and wasn't really expecting much.</p>
<p>After sitting around for a couple of months (okay, more like a handful) I finally opened them up one day and plugged them in. Surprisingly, they work pretty dang good. I'm in no way a sound expert, but I dare say for the average (music) listener these will work perfectly fine.</p>
<p>These are built quite well, better than similarly priced Sony headphones, and the padding on the top is very comfortable.</p>
<p>The only thing I don't like about these is I can't seem to find the perfect adjustment; they seem to push (ever so slightly) harder into my head above my ears as opposed to below.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they work quite well, and the volume adjustment on the cord is also quite nice.</p>
