<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EYNLXRI?tag=strivinglifen-20" rel="external">Rolodex Mesh Mobile Device Tablet Stand</a>, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program.</p></div>

<h3>Perfect with my Nexus 7</h3>

<p>I currently have a Nexus 7 with a case that allows a certain level of tilting. However, since the case is relatively soft, it doesn't work as well as I'd like. I was also looking at purchasing a larger tablet over the holiday season, so when I saw this up for review I jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p>First, the packaging for the stand itself is horrid. Absolutely horrid. Getting the top open was a pain, and then trying to get the stand out of the box resulted in the far end getting caught on the front plastic (which ends a bit below the front opening on the container that lets you see the product).</p>

<p>The product itself rocks. Closed it's relatively tiny, and inclines to a number of nice angles. Given the size of the base I've found it easy to place on soft surfaces almost as well as hard ones.</p>

<p>The size of the stand also allows my cased Nexus 7 to fit rather comfortably. It does cover the volume button a bit, but that's ultimately not an issue with the stand itself.</p>

<p>It's constructed fairly well, and with normal use I don't expect it to be damaged. However, I could see it being damaged if it were opened to an incline and then forced close (something fell on it). But that's a usage issue.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I give it the full 5 stars as it performs what it was built for perfectly.</p>
