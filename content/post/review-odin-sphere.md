<div class="note">
<p>The following is a review of <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IONGU4?tag=strivinglifen-20">Odin Sphere</a>, for the Playstation 2.</p>
</div>
<p>I really enjoyed the ads for <a rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HB7K6I?tag=strivinglifen-20">Muramasa: The Demon Blade</a>, since the game looked so very beautiful, and the game looked rather enjoyable.</p>
<p>I bought it a few days after it came out and enjoyed it immensely. After some research I found that they had previously done this game, Odin Sphere, and thought it would be worth a play. However, for whatever reason I kept putting off the purchase.</p>
<p>A few months ago I finally spent the money. At first I was expecting Muramasa's combat, so I got my butt kicked. However, once I realized that Odin Sphere requires tactics, I had a much easier and enjoyable time.</p>
<p>The story is spread out between 5 characters, with varying degrees of overlap. However, you start out with one character, and after finishing their story, unlock the next, until all five are unlocked. This is, quite honestly, a bit disappointing, but to some extent makes sense within the scope of the larger story.</p>
<p>After the last character is finished a final level is playable, which allows for two different endings.</p>
<p>You can replay any character's story, but you can't pick a specific chapter to play. So once you've finished the first character, you can play their story again but must start at the beginning. You can switch to any other unlocked character at any time, but if you start playing the first again, you pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>4 of 5 stars only because I played Muramasa: The Demon Blade first, and how they perfected this game.</p>
<p>Playstation 3 note: I played this on my 80 GB Playstation 3 and experienced no excessive lag at all, which is supposedly present when playing on a Playstation 2.</p>
