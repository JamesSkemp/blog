      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a review of &lt;a rel=&#34;external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416569790?tag=strivinglifen-20&#34;&gt;Manufacturing Depression: The Secret History of a Modern Disease&lt;/a&gt;, written by Gary Greenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected this book based on the following lines of a highlighted review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He offers a measured dose of philosophy in contemplating whether unhappiness should be regarded as a disease or instead as an essential part of being human. Ultimately, his book is a sobering critique of the marketing wizards who have overhyped the dubious benefits of antidepressants and of an American public all too eager for quick fixes to life&amp;rsquo;s inevitable challenges and disappointments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the philosophical aspects are barely touched upon, focusing instead on the historical aspects, and current state of affairs. Despite this, Greenberg&amp;rsquo;s writing style is fairly nice, albeit at times disjointed, making this an interesting read, especially in regards to the history of depression and attempts to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, however, it was extremely difficult for me to pick up the book and start reading it, despite enjoying the previous day&amp;rsquo;s chapter(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg merely alludes to the philosophical aspects of depression, so I&amp;rsquo;d recommend this book more towards those interested in the historical aspects. Those who believe they suffer from depression and (may) need pills to feel better/normal, may also enjoy reading this book. Despite getting into technical discussions on the body, the book is suited for the average reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 of 5 stars as I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but had a hard time picking it up to read another chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
