<p>Released earlier today, <a rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/06/29/site-ready-html5-second-ie10-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx">Internet Explorer 10: Platform Preview 2</a> is now available for download.</p>
<p>Just the other day at work I had fired up IE10PP1 to see if a new version was available, so I'll just go ahead and assume Microsoft was zeroing in on my brainwaves with this.</p>
<p>I definitely like the direction they've gone with these platform previews, so I hope to see that continue.</p>
<p>And that's about all I have to say about that.</p>
