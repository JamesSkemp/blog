I&#39;ve never been to New York City, at least, not that I can recall. However, media has, for various reasons, touched upon the city in a number of formats, in a number of ways, for a number of years. Without having ever been to New York City, I can say the following about it.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Stay out of New York City.</li>
	<li>Common wisdom is right, New Yorkers are less human than people in other cities.</li>
	<li>Hollywood and New York City have more in common than you&#39;d think.</li>
	<li>If something bad is going to happen to the United States, it&#39;ll start in New York City.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The initial reason I decided to write down these simple ideas was because I had just watched <em>The Invasion</em> this morning. Years ago, I wrote a, oft-referred-to, piece on beautiful women, and Nicole Kidman was not present on that list. However, as she gets older, I enjoy her movies all the more.

The movie was good, more so because, as my sister pointed out, there didn&#39;t seem to be any wasted scenes; every scene held some value within it. I have not seen the original movie that this is derived from, but I will indeed be looking at Netflix this evening to see if I can watch it online.
