The following is a review of [CRAVE Grain Free High Protein Salmon Paté Wet Cat Food Trays][review], received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## Messy to Open, Despite Little Juice

We have three cats of varying ages, who mostly free-graze on dry food throughout the day. As a treat we'll give them varying types of wet food, with one of them just lapping up the juices, and the other two eating what they can.

The first thing you'll notice about CRAVE wet cat food trays is that when you open them you'll have juice spray out at you. This is suprising because you might then think that there's quite a lot of juice contained within, which isn't the case. Even after all of them I've opened to this point I couldn't prevent this, but I've taken to tipping them and opening them in one of the cat's bowls, specifically the cat who mostly just likes the juice.

On the bright side, while there's two packages of food combined together, I never had an issue with breaking them apart. With three cats, each got a pack, so I had to split one or two double packs at a time.

As far as the food itself, I didn't try it, so I can't speak to the taste. However, it looked and smelled fine, and our three cats seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. I'd say that one of our cats liked it more than the others, and since there's not that much juice (since it's paté), another left much of it to his brothers.

Ultimately, I'm neutral about CRAVE's product. Grain free is nice, and the price is comparable to other brands. I just wish it was easier to open them without juice spraying about. For these reasons I give [CRAVE Grain Free High Protein Salmon Paté Wet Cat Food Trays][review] four of five stars.
