<p>
The release of Appleseed: Ex Machina (2007) came as a bit of surprise to me, since I hadn&#39;t heard it was coming out (not that I generally look very hard into these things). 
</p>
<p>
Initial reviews seemed mixed - pretty and featuring direct John Woo influence, but no story. When I saw it was available for Netflix instant viewing, I couldn&#39;t resist. 
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s true that the story is pretty simple, i.e. you&#39;ll know generally what&#39;s going to happen before it happens, the story really wasn&#39;t that bad - after all, the most important part is how they move from one point to another. We see both of our true favorites, Deunan and Briareos (voiced by &#39;Togusa&#39;), along with old and supporting cast. 
</p>
<p>
Visually, the movie is extremely pleasing. The ~9 minute intro isn&#39;t quite as quick or stunning&nbsp;as Appleseed (2004)&#39;s (IMO), but it&#39;s pretty dang close (and may be more of an impact because it was the first featuring this style of animation). 
</p>
<p>
The character models in the 2004 version did get a bit of grief about movement, and you&#39;ll still see some of that here. However, seeing as how Japan excels at life-like animation, it&#39;s no surprise that they&#39;ve made some improvement here. 
</p>
<p>
As an&nbsp;aside, I already mentioned that I watched the Netflix instant version of this movie.&nbsp;I was amazed and rather pleasantly surprised&nbsp;by&nbsp;both the quality of the video and&nbsp;it was presented with Japanese audio and&nbsp;English subtitles.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I gave this movie 5 of 5 stars, since I can see adding this to my collection in the near future.
