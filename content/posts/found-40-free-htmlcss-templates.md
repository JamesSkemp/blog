<p>Alessandro Fulciniti, along with an unnamed number of people, have create 40 CSS-based templates, free for download, available at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/" target="_blank">http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/</a>.</p>
<p>They've got near every possible layout that I can think of, along with a number more. Stick on a stylesheet, and you're golden.</p>
<p>The only real problem I see is that navigation items should, according to some sources, come before the main content area. After all if the CSS disappears, then you'll still want navigation to come first.</p>
<p>But will you really? After all, search bots check the beginning of pages first for content, and work their way down. And, people are probably coming to your site via search engines, so they'll be interested in the content, before they take a look at the rest of your site.</p>
