<p>
I like PDFs.
</p>
<p>
While a number of individuals will attack PDFs with blanket statements, PDFs are a great way to allow users to print documents from the Internet as intended.&nbsp; So, instead of printing off a Web page and losing 10 to 20 characters from the right-side, you can print off a document formatted specifically for printers.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you use them as the sole content delivery method, you may run into issues.
</p>
<p>
For StrivingLife.net, PDFs make sense, since I assume people will be printing these documents off for future reference.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I have scholarly and technical information, for the most part.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, in today&#39;s world, problems with PDFs are fairly uncommon, as long the PDF is created correctly.
</p>
<p>
To create the PDFs on my site, I first created the article in Microsoft Word.&nbsp; Next, I converted the file to PDF using Adobe Acrobat Professional&#39;s PDF conversion plug-in.&nbsp; From there, a quick &#39;Save as&#39;, to verify that the file size is as small as possible, and it&#39;s ready for publication.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t placed security on my files before, and don&#39;t really feel that there&#39;s much need to for my public files.
</p>
<p>
Today I tried a couple of new methods to create PDFs.
</p>
<p>
First, OpenOffice - OpenOffice.org - allows you to create PDFs with their office suite, without the purchase or use of a third-party utility.
</p>
<p>
Second, Macromedia&#39;s FlashPaper 2 allows you to create PDFs from Microsoft Office programs.
</p>
<p>
Testing these two alternatives, I found that the PDFs they create are far too bulky for my purposes.
</p>
<p>
First, I created a PDF from Microsoft Word, using the Adobe Acrobat 6.0 PDFMaker.&nbsp; This resulted in a 27 KB PDF.
</p>
<p>
Next, I created a PDF from OpenOffice Writer, using PDF conversion.&nbsp; This resulted in a 82 KB PDF.&nbsp; Printing to Distiller resulted in a 20 KB file.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I created a PDF using Microsoft Word and Macromedia FlashPaper 2, which resulted in a 88 KB file.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, I&#39;ll be sticking with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat.
</p>
<p>
I will be experimenting with Macromedia FlashPaper&#39;s ability to create Flash conversions of documents.&nbsp; This allows the viewing and printing of a document via the Flash plug-in.
</p>
<p>
File sizes for both conversion from Microsoft Word, as well as from the PDF, are about 70 KB (converting from PDF is slightly larger).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be doing my testing on <a href="http://DoNotDenyMyUnicorn.com/">http://DoNotDenyMyUnicorn.com/</a>, so head over there if you&#39;d like to test these methods out.
