My birthday happens to be today, and when I started checking my email this morning, I was presented with 4 different birthday greetings, from 4 different forums.  I&#39;m aware that forums have been doing this for a long time, so what struck me is the forums I signed up for, but don&#39;t remember doing so :D  (That&#39;s also a little security-scary<sup><a id="link1" name="link1" href="#note1" title="link1">1</a></sup>, but I know I&#39;m signed up with many more that don&#39;t appear to be sending birthday greetings.)<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been thinking about the worth of a good deal of holidays, especially when it comes to gifts.  This year, we&#39;re going to spend little - hopefully nothing - on Christmas, and more on birthdays.  We&#39;re doing this for a number of reasons.<!--adsense-->
</p>
<p>
First, Christmas time is a usually the worst time to be shopping, since it&#39;s so busy.
</p>
<p>
Second, after doing all of that shopping, there&#39;s no time to enjoy either the season or the gifts.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, not every family can get together for every birthday - it&#39;s easier to get together for just one day, even if it is the busiest day.
</p>
<p>
Third, birthdays mean more.  We&#39;re not a religious family - they believe in some God, and I&#39;m a Schopenhauerian<sup><a id="link2" name="link2" href="#note2" title="link2">2</a></sup> - so Christmas for us, and for a vast majority of the American people (no matter what faith they may say they believe in) is just another day we&#39;re off from work, and one that tradition says must be filled with good food and gifts - like Thanksgiving.

Back to the emails I received today, this was a great feature of the board&#39;s software.  Not only do a get a generic birthday greeting, but more importantly, I get a reminder of my involvement in the board.  Some of these four I&#39;m not going to be checking up on, but at least 2 I will be, since my interest has grown in said areas (they are more techie boards).  It&#39;s been a while, and I&#39;d like to see just how they&#39;ve grown.
</p>
<p>
What I checked into was a Wordpress plugin for this as well.  However, Wordpress users don&#39;t currently enter a birthday.  So, it would involve creating another field for the user, and then creating a notification if it&#39;s the user&#39;s birthday.  It could be totally optional, but may just bring readers closer to a site, or at least give them a reminder on a good day to do so.  After all, there are few days as personal as the day of one&#39;s birth (which, thereby, could be number four for the list above).

<a id="note1" name="note1" href="#link1" title="note1">1</a>: Security-scary simply because it&#39;s another way to find out personal information about me.  Of course, these days Google will give you everything you need to know about a person - and I don&#39;t mind.  I want people to be able to do a search for me and find out how to contact me.  You never know ...
</p>
<p>
<a id="note2" name="note2" href="#link2" title="note2">2</a>: As in, I find Arthur Schopenhauer to have a good stand on life.  Whether that requires a God is questionable indeed, since, in a way, the Will is a kind of standard god (lowercase intentional).  I&#39;m not sure whether Schopenhauerian is the correct term or not ...

One note that didn&rsquo;t make it into this is that Mother&rsquo;s Day and Father&rsquo;s Day appear to be more Hallmark Days than anything, much like Secretary&rsquo;s Day, and etcetera. These &lsquo;Day&rsquo;s are only necessary because we forget that these people should be thanked on a regular basis, not for doing their &lsquo;job&rsquo;, but also for just being who they are - someone close to us, or someone who provides some assistance to us.
</p>
<p>
Of course, as with Christmas, having a specific day helps draw attention, on a large/national scale. So, there&rsquo;s some benefit to it, however, too much consumerism is a bad thing - is it better to show how much you appreciate the Secretary by buying her a gift, or do you thank her in other ways?
</p>
<p>
(Of course, now that the day exists, the Secretary, if smart, will want that material aspect to it, perhaps in the form of a bonus, or better in my opinion, a raise.)
