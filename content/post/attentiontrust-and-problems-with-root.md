<p>
If my last post got you interested in the AttentionTrust project, and you downloaded the extension, are using it now, and are reading this on StrivingLife.net (whew, lot&#39;s of &#39;if&#39;s), then you may have noticed that StrivingLife.net is now a certified member.&nbsp; What does that mean for you?
</p>
<p>
First, that I agree with four principles that the AttentionTrust organization puts forward;
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	1. Property : You own your attention and can store it wherever you wish.<br />
	2. Mobility : You can securely move your attention wherever you want whenever you want to.<br />
	3. Economy : You can pay attention to whomever you wish and receive value in return.<br />
	4. Transparency : You can see exactly how your attention is being used.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Second, that I&#39;ll be moving closer towards these goals.&nbsp; One of the things I&#39;ve believed in for a long time is that one should share information on the Internet, hence the numerous articles that I&#39;ve written and provided for free.
</p>
<p>
While I do not believe that a free Internet is feasible, information should not be associated with a dollar sign.
</p>
<p>
To that end, one way to pay someone back for the information they provide is by simply leaving a comment.&nbsp; In other words, giving attention is value.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;ve believed in this for a number of years, and mentioned it here and there, I&#39;ve never made sure it was immediately in view - that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ll be working towards.
</p>

On another note, I&#39;m still having problems accessing the Root Vault that I setup yesterday.&nbsp; It appears that since I&#39;ve reset my password I&#39;ve been unable to log back in ...&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I&#39;ve got a request off to support, so I&#39;ll be sure to pass on what I find.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking at the Attention Toolkit to see if I can&#39;t write some code to allow someone to access their own data on their own computer (so long as they have PHP installed).&nbsp; Again, I&#39;ll pass on what I create.
