<p>
I&#39;ve applied a new style today to this part of the site.  The old style had been used for quite a long while, and it was definitely time for a change.<!--more--><!--adsense-->

Comments/suggestions welcome.

<strong>Update</strong>: The photo was taken in the County of Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin, on May 21, 2006. I actually have a number of pictures from this site, and the woods (to the left), almost all of which I really like (making that a pretty good shoot).

In general, northern Wisconsin is full of places like this, and the rest of the state has it&#39;s fair share as well.
