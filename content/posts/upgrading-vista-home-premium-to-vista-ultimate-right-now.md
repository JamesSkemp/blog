<p>
About&nbsp;30 minutes ago I started upgrading from Vista Home Premium to Vista Ultimate, using a NFS copy of Ultimate I received at the Heroes Happen {Here} event in &#39;Madison&#39; (today). 
</p>
<p>
For the most part, everything is backed up, so it should be a painless install, no matter what happens. 
</p>
<p>
Five steps; 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<div>
	Copying Windows files 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Gathering files 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Expanding files 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Installing features and updates 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Completing upgrade 
	</div>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
What&#39;s initially scary is the &quot;Your upgrade may take several hours to complete.&quot; line at the bottom of the screen. 
</p>
<p>
But, I&#39;ve got Zatoichi 9 that I&#39;m watching, so ... it shouldn&#39;t be all that bad. 
</p>
<p>
(I do wish I would have installed Visual Studio 2008 after I had upgraded, though, but I wasn&#39;t sure that I&#39;d be able to, so ...) 
</p>
