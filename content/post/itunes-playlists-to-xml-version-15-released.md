<div class="warning">
<p>This application has since been updated. <a href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Version 1.5 of iTunes Playlists to Xml is now available for download.</p>
<p>Download <a rel="external download" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/iTunesPlaylistsToXml_1.5.zip">iTunes Playlists to Xml 1.5</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing and more information</h3>
<p>If you're new to iTunes Playlists to Xml, I've created a 'product page' for <a rel="external" href="http://jamesrskemp.com/apps/iTunesPlaylists2Xml/">iTunes Playlists to Xml</a> with all the information needed to get started.</p>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>any version of 1.4</strong> you simply need to replace the <strong>iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe</strong> file with the one in the above archive. You should not need to update your configuration.</p>
<p>To upgrade from <strong>version 1.3 or earlier</strong>, extract the contents of the zip replacing everything <em>but</em> the iTunesPlaylistsToXml.exe.config file; when you start the application after upgrading the configuration file <em>should</em> be automatically upgraded with all new settings. If you get a configuration error, then replace this file with the new version. Remember to update your name in the Settings.</p>
<h3>Changes from version 1.4.1</h3>
<p>Version 1.5 of iTunes Playlists to Xml adds the Compilation flag as an optional output (output as either true or false).</p>
<p>Along with this, you can now have the application replace the artist name, for tracks part of a compilation, with other text. This <em>does not</em> require the Compilation flag to be output to the Xml file. (<em>This is a&nbsp;hack for a limitation with the iTunes API for Windows that doesn't make the album artist field available.</em>) This is set via the Settings, and will apply to all future outputs, until changed.</p>
<p>The Settings item has also been updated to have the application automatically connect to iTunes when it starts (versus having to manually use the Connect menu option).</p>
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>As always, comments and suggestions are appreciated.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Pierre for his feedback, which has directly resulted in this new release.</p>
