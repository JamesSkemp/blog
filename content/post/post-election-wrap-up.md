First, is good to see Doyle re-elected.&nbsp; Related to this, thanks to <a href="http://framingbusiness.net/" target="_blank">Gavin</a> for the information he provides on Green.

Second, it&#39;s unfortunate that Wisconsin has decided to make a constitutional amendment to &quot;provide that only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state and that a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized in this state.&quot;
