<p>
While not yet announced on the official blog, Firmware 2.41 is out this morning for the Playstation 3.
</p>
<p>
No word yet on what happened with 2.40, but, that&#39;s to be expected I suppose (and unfortunately).
</p>
<p>
(I didn&#39;t get 2.40 when it was out - they seem to release these in the morning, and most days I&#39;m at work in the morning.)
</p>
<p>
Now if only you got something that really <em>mattered</em> when you got a trophy/achievement/what-have-you ...
