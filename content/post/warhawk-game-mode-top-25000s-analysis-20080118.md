<p>
I&#39;m a statistics kind of guy. I like numbers, since they&#39;re logical. I also like trends, and all that. 
</p>
<p>
So, here&#39;s a look at the current trends for what it takes to get into the top 25k, 50k, 75k, 100k, 150k, 200k, and 300k in the various game modes in Warhawk. Undoubtedly I&#39;ll have another post like this next month, around the same time. 
</p>
<p>
With over 417,000 players, total, these equate to around the top 6%, 12.5%, 18.75%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, and 75%. 
</p>
<p>
Clearly, there are some modes that&nbsp;a number of individuals are not playing. This in turn means a smaller number of points need to be earned to enter the top players, world-wide.
