<p>
Right or wrong, GameStop was in stock and selling pre-orders of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IVXI7C?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">LittleBigPlanet</a> today, so I was able to pick up my copy, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0744010446?tag=strivinglifen-20" target="_blank">official guide</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Thus far I&#39;ve gone through four complete areas, and picked up the trophies accordingly. 
</p>
<p>
On only the first level did I actually get a 100% (but not the Ace award), and with the later levels, I had to retry a number of times. 
</p>
<p>
It seems also that there are some issues with movement, in particular from the foreground to background, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t played much with the creation functionality, since I want to go through the game once (and then pick up the missing items as time goes by), but I did go through the tutorials, and the Brady guide should otherwise help.
