The following is a review of the Microsoft Surface Keyboard, received as part of the Amazon Vine program.

## For Desktop Use, Works Great

When I purchased my [Surface Pro 4][surface-pro] a while ago I ended up purchasing a [Type Cover][type-cover] to go along with it. In addition to protecting the Surface's screen it works great as a keyboard.

When given the chance to try out the [Surface Keyboard][review] I took the opportunity, to see if it would provide a better experience when at home.

The Surface Keyboard uses Bluetooth to connect to the Surface, and given the defaults, worked immediately, once I had entered the necessary numbers from my Surface.

The keyboard reminds me a bit of a Mac keyboard, from the slim look to the feel of the keys. However, I actually like the Surface keyboard more; it feels more solid.

The full number pad is a very welcome addition, compared to the Type Cover. However, the special features associated with the function keys are different than what they are on the Type Cover. I'm not sure why this is, and if you have muscle memory with these already, you can expect to run into some initial difficulties.

What I would have liked to have seen was a way to switch off the keyboard, like there is with the [Microsoft Surface Mouse][surface-mouse]. Otherwise, I had no issues while using this.

For portable use I would still stick with a [Type Cover][type-cover], keeping this on your desktop for home or office use. With that in mind, right now I give the [Surface Keyboard][review] five of five stars, keeping in mind it's a premium product at a premium price.
