<div class="note"><p>The following is a review of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/46480/">Still Life</a> (2005), available for PC on Steam.</p></div>

<h3>Great story, interesting puzzles</h3>

<p>Having liked <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/46500/">Syberia</a> (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up.</p>

<p>While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.</p>

<p>Still Life eventually ends up following the lives of two characters, with the real focus on one, Victoria. While at times she seemed like a bit of a teenager (attitude), I actually enjoyed her character pretty dang well. The other character is also interesting, and ... well, spoiler, look forward to playing as him when I get around to Post Mortem.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles are rather challenging, and I'll readily admit that I opted to just look at a guide as time went on; I'm not as smart as I once was, and really I was just digging the story. I have no shame in admitting that.</p>

<p>I look forward to playing the rest of the games in this series. Honestly, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/46480/">Still Life</a> gets 5 of 5 stars.</p>
