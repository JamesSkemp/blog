Wow. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine Black, but with stealth, better graphics, and less damagable property, but definitely better sound and effects. 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s Metal Gear Solid 4. 
</p>
<p>
Despite the fact that I don&#39;t play these types of games very often, I only died three times. (Granted, I&#39;m playing one level above wuss.) However, I&#39;m not very fair in, since I&#39;ve actually been something of a collector in my travels. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also yet to get used to the sneaking about (oh, you have to hold the button down to grab them, then slash), so I&#39;ve basically been stealth walking about, bailing out militia. 
</p>
<p>
Controls are pretty smooth. The camera is a bit annoying, but not too horrible. My controller may be to blame, since it&#39;s what I got with my PS3, hence, it&#39;s seen quite a bit of use.
